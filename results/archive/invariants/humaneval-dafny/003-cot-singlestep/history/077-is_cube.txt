The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method cube_root(N: nat) returns (r: nat)
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures cube(r) <= N < cube(r + 1)
  ensures r <= N
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  r := 0;
  while cube(r + 1) <= N
  {
    r := r + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}
method is_cube(n: nat) returns (r: bool)
  // pre-conditions-start
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures r ==> exists r :: 0 <= r <= n && n == cube(r)
  ensures !r ==> forall r :: 0 <= r <= n ==> n != cube(r)
  // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    var root := cube_root(n);
    if cube(root) == n {
        r := true;
    } else {
        cube_of_larger_is_larger();
        r := false;
    }
    // impl-end
}
function cube(n: int): int { n * n * n }
lemma cube_of_larger_is_larger()
    ensures forall smaller : int, larger : int :: smaller <= larger ==> cube(smaller) <= cube(larger)
{}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The `cube_root` method:
   - It takes a natural number N and returns the largest natural number r such that r^3 <= N < (r+1)^3.
   - The method uses a while loop to increment r until (r+1)^3 > N.

2. The `is_cube` method:
   - It checks if a given natural number n is a perfect cube.
   - It uses the `cube_root` method to find the potential cube root.
   - If cube(root) == n, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

3. The `cube` function:
   - It calculates the cube of a given integer.

4. The `cube_of_larger_is_larger` lemma:
   - It states that for any two integers, if one is larger or equal, its cube is also larger or equal.

Now, let's add invariants and assertions:

For the `cube_root` method:
- We need an invariant to ensure that r^3 <= N at each iteration.
- We also need to ensure that r <= N to satisfy the post-condition.

For the `is_cube` method:
- We don't need to add any invariants as there are no loops.
- We can add an assertion to help prove the post-conditions.

Here's the program with added invariants and assertions:

<answer>
method cube_root(N: nat) returns (r: nat)
  ensures cube(r) <= N < cube(r + 1)
  ensures r <= N
{
  r := 0;
  while cube(r + 1) <= N
    invariant cube(r) <= N
    invariant r <= N
  {
    r := r + 1;
  }
}

method is_cube(n: nat) returns (r: bool)
  ensures r ==> exists r :: 0 <= r <= n && n == cube(r)
  ensures !r ==> forall r :: 0 <= r <= n ==> n != cube(r)
{
    var root := cube_root(n);
    if cube(root) == n {
        r := true;
        assert 0 <= root <= n && n == cube(root);
    } else {
        cube_of_larger_is_larger();
        assert forall r :: 0 <= r <= n ==> n != cube(r);
        r := false;
    }
}

function cube(n: int): int { n * n * n }

lemma cube_of_larger_is_larger()
    ensures forall smaller : int, larger : int :: smaller <= larger ==> cube(smaller) <= cube(larger)
{}
</answer>

Explanation of added invariants and assertions:

1. In the `cube_root` method:
   - The invariant `cube(r) <= N` ensures that at each iteration, r^3 is not greater than N.
   - The invariant `r <= N` ensures that r doesn't exceed N, satisfying the post-condition.

2. In the `is_cube` method:
   - The assertion `assert 0 <= root <= n && n == cube(root);` in the true branch helps prove the first post-condition.
   - The assertion `assert forall r :: 0 <= r <= n ==> n != cube(r);` in the false branch helps prove the second post-condition.

These additions should help Dafny verify the correctness of the program according to the given specifications.
