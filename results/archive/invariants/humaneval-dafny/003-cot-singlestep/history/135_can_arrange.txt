The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method can_arrange(arr: seq<int>) returns (pos: int)
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires |arr| > 0
  requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |arr| ==> arr[i] != arr[j]
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures pos == -1 ==> forall i :: 1 <= i < |arr| ==> arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]
  ensures pos >= 0 ==> 1 <= pos < |arr| && arr[pos] < arr[pos - 1]
  ensures pos >= 0 ==> forall i :: pos < i < |arr| ==> arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  var i := 1;
  pos := -1;
  while i < |arr|
  {
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1] {
      pos := i;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program step by step:

1. The method `can_arrange` takes a sequence of integers `arr` as input and returns an integer `pos`.

2. The preconditions state that:
   - The array must not be empty.
   - All elements in the array are unique.

3. The postconditions state that:
   - If `pos` is -1, the array is already sorted in ascending order.
   - If `pos` is not -1, it points to the first element that is smaller than its predecessor, and all elements after `pos` are in ascending order.

4. The implementation uses a loop to iterate through the array, starting from index 1, and checks if each element is smaller than its predecessor. If such an element is found, `pos` is set to its index.

Now, let's think about the invariants we need:

1. We need to maintain that `i` is always within the bounds of the array:
   `invariant 1 <= i <= |arr|`

2. We need to ensure that if `pos` is not -1, it points to the first element smaller than its predecessor:
   `invariant pos == -1 || (1 <= pos < i && arr[pos] < arr[pos-1])`

3. We need to ensure that all elements after `pos` (up to `i`) are in ascending order:
   `invariant pos >= 0 ==> forall k :: pos < k < i ==> arr[k] >= arr[k-1]`

4. We need to ensure that if `pos` is -1, all elements up to `i` are in ascending order:
   `invariant pos == -1 ==> forall k :: 1 <= k < i ==> arr[k] >= arr[k-1]`

With these invariants, we can prove that the postconditions hold when the loop terminates (when `i == |arr|`).

Here's the program with the added invariants and assertions:

<answer>
method can_arrange(arr: seq<int>) returns (pos: int)
  requires |arr| > 0
  requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |arr| ==> arr[i] != arr[j]
  ensures pos == -1 ==> forall i :: 1 <= i < |arr| ==> arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]
  ensures pos >= 0 ==> 1 <= pos < |arr| && arr[pos] < arr[pos - 1]
  ensures pos >= 0 ==> forall i :: pos < i < |arr| ==> arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]
{
  var i := 1;
  pos := -1;
  while i < |arr|
    invariant 1 <= i <= |arr|
    invariant pos == -1 || (1 <= pos < i && arr[pos] < arr[pos-1])
    invariant pos >= 0 ==> forall k :: pos < k < i ==> arr[k] >= arr[k-1]
    invariant pos == -1 ==> forall k :: 1 <= k < i ==> arr[k] >= arr[k-1]
  {
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1] {
      pos := i;
      assert arr[pos] < arr[pos-1];
    }
    i := i + 1;
    assert pos == -1 || pos < i;
    assert pos >= 0 ==> forall k :: pos < k < i ==> arr[k] >= arr[k-1];
  }
  assert i == |arr|;
}
</answer>

The added assertions help Dafny verify that the invariants are maintained throughout the loop. The final assertion `assert i == |arr|;` helps Dafny connect the loop invariants to the postconditions when the loop terminates.
