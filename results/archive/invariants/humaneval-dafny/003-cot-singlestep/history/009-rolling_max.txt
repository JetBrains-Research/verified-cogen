The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
datatype Option<T> = None | Some(T)
function getVal(mx : Option<int>) : int
    requires exists i : int :: mx == Some(i)
{
    match mx {
        case Some(n) => n
    }
}
method rolling_max(numbers: seq<int>) returns (result : seq<int>)
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures |numbers| == |result|
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |numbers| ==> numbers[i] <= result[i]
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i + 1 < |numbers| ==> result[i] <= result[i + 1]
    // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    var running_max: Option<int> := None;
    result := [];
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        var n : int := numbers[i];
        match running_max {
            case None => running_max := Some(n);
            case Some(n1) =>
            {
                if (n1 < n) {
                    running_max := Some(n);
                }
            }
        }
        match running_max {
            case Some(n1) => result := result + [n1];
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The program defines an Option datatype and a getVal function to extract the value from a Some option.

2. The main method, rolling_max, takes a sequence of integers and returns another sequence of integers representing the rolling maximum.

3. The post-conditions ensure that:
   a. The output sequence has the same length as the input.
   b. Each element in the result is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in the input.
   c. The result sequence is non-decreasing.

Now, let's add invariants to the while loop:

1. Loop bounds: 0 <= i <= |numbers|
2. Result length: |result| == i
3. Running max correctness: running_max == None ==> i == 0
4. Result correctness: 
   a. forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> numbers[j] <= result[j]
   b. forall j :: 0 <= j < i-1 ==> result[j] <= result[j+1]
5. Running max value: 
   running_max != None ==> getVal(running_max) == result[i-1]

We'll also add some assertions to help prove the invariants and post-conditions.

Here's the program with added invariants and assertions:

<answer>
datatype Option<T> = None | Some(T)

function getVal(mx : Option<int>) : int
    requires exists i : int :: mx == Some(i)
{
    match mx {
        case Some(n) => n
    }
}

method rolling_max(numbers: seq<int>) returns (result : seq<int>)
    ensures |numbers| == |result|
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |numbers| ==> numbers[i] <= result[i]
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i + 1 < |numbers| ==> result[i] <= result[i + 1]
{
    var running_max: Option<int> := None;
    result := [];
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant running_max == None ==> i == 0
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> numbers[j] <= result[j]
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i-1 ==> result[j] <= result[j+1]
        invariant running_max != None ==> getVal(running_max) == result[i-1]
    {
        var n : int := numbers[i];
        match running_max {
            case None => 
                running_max := Some(n);
                assert getVal(running_max) == n;
            case Some(n1) =>
            {
                if (n1 < n) {
                    running_max := Some(n);
                    assert getVal(running_max) == n;
                } else {
                    assert getVal(running_max) == n1;
                }
                assert getVal(running_max) >= n1;
            }
        }
        match running_max {
            case Some(n1) => 
                result := result + [n1];
                assert n1 >= n;
                if i > 0 {
                    assert n1 >= result[i-1];
                }
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    assert i == |numbers|;
    assert |result| == |numbers|;
}
</answer>

Explanation of added invariants and assertions:

1. The loop invariants ensure that the loop index i is within bounds, the result sequence grows with each iteration, and the running_max option is None only at the start.

2. We assert that the running_max value is always greater than or equal to the current number, which helps prove that the result sequence is non-decreasing.

3. We add assertions to show that the new element added to the result sequence is always greater than or equal to the current number and the previous maximum.

4. The final assertions help Dafny prove that the post-conditions are satisfied when the loop terminates.

These additions should help Dafny verify that the implementation satisfies the specified post-conditions.

LLM: I apologize for the oversight. The error occurs because when i is 0, i-1 is out of range for the result sequence. Let's modify the invariant to account for this case. Here's the corrected program:

<answer>
datatype Option<T> = None | Some(T)

function getVal(mx : Option<int>) : int
    requires exists i : int :: mx == Some(i)
{
    match mx {
        case Some(n) => n
    }
}

method rolling_max(numbers: seq<int>) returns (result : seq<int>)
    ensures |numbers| == |result|
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |numbers| ==> numbers[i] <= result[i]
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i + 1 < |numbers| ==> result[i] <= result[i + 1]
{
    var running_max: Option<int> := None;
    result := [];
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant running_max == None ==> i == 0
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> numbers[j] <= result[j]
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i-1 ==> result[j] <= result[j+1]
        invariant running_max != None ==> i > 0 && getVal(running_max) == result[i-1]
    {
        var n : int := numbers[i];
        match running_max {
            case None => 
                running_max := Some(n);
                assert getVal(running_max) == n;
            case Some(n1) =>
            {
                if (n1 < n) {
                    running_max := Some(n);
                    assert getVal(running_max) == n;
                } else {
                    assert getVal(running_max) == n1;
                }
                assert getVal(running_max) >= n1;
            }
        }
        match running_max {
            case Some(n1) => 
                result := result + [n1];
                assert n1 >= n;
                if i > 0 {
                    assert n1 >= result[i-1];
                }
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    assert i == |numbers|;
    assert |result| == |numbers|;
}
</answer>

The key change is in the last invariant:

```dafny
invariant running_max != None ==> i > 0 && getVal(running_max) == result[i-1]
```

We've added the condition `i > 0` to ensure that we only access `result[i-1]` when i is greater than 0. This should resolve the "index out of range" error.

This modification maintains the correctness of the invariant while avoiding the out-of-range access when i is 0. The rest of the program remains the same, as the other invariants and assertions were correct and helpful for proving the post-conditions.
