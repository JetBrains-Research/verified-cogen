The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method checkSubstring(s: string, sub: string) returns (result: bool)
{
    // impl-start
    result := false;
    if (|sub| == 0)
    {
        result := true;
    }
    else if (|s| >= |sub|)
    {
        var i: int := 0;
        while (i <= |s| - |sub|)
        {
            if (s[i..i + |sub|] == sub)
            {
                result := true;
            }
            i := i + 1;
        }
    }
    // impl-end
}
method filter_by_substring(strings: seq<string>, substring: string) returns (res : seq<string>)
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures |res| <= |strings|
    ensures (forall s :: s in res ==> s in strings)
    // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    res := [];
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |strings|)
    {
        var check : bool := checkSubstring(strings[i], substring);
        if (check)
        {
            res := res + [strings[i]];
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. checkSubstring method:
   This method checks if 'sub' is a substring of 's'. We don't need to modify this method as it's not the main focus of the verification task.

2. filter_by_substring method:
   This method filters a sequence of strings based on whether they contain a given substring. We need to add invariants to the while loop to prove the post-conditions.

Let's consider the post-conditions:
a. |res| <= |strings|
b. (forall s :: s in res ==> s in strings)

To prove these, we need to maintain the following invariants in the while loop:

1. 0 <= i <= |strings|
   This ensures that our loop variable stays within bounds.

2. |res| <= i
   This helps prove the first post-condition. Since i will eventually equal |strings|, this invariant implies |res| <= |strings|.

3. forall j :: 0 <= j < |res| ==> res[j] in strings[..i]
   This helps prove the second post-condition. It states that every element in res is from the part of strings we've already processed.

4. forall j :: 0 <= j < |res| ==> checkSubstring(res[j], substring)
   This ensures that every string in res contains the substring.

Now, let's add these invariants and some helpful assertions:

<answer>
method checkSubstring(s: string, sub: string) returns (result: bool)
{
    result := false;
    if (|sub| == 0)
    {
        result := true;
    }
    else if (|s| >= |sub|)
    {
        var i: int := 0;
        while (i <= |s| - |sub|)
        {
            if (s[i..i + |sub|] == sub)
            {
                result := true;
            }
            i := i + 1;
        }
    }
}

method filter_by_substring(strings: seq<string>, substring: string) returns (res : seq<string>)
    ensures |res| <= |strings|
    ensures (forall s :: s in res ==> s in strings)
{
    res := [];
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |strings|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |strings|
        invariant |res| <= i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |res| ==> res[j] in strings[..i]
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |res| ==> checkSubstring(res[j], substring)
    {
        var check : bool := checkSubstring(strings[i], substring);
        if (check)
        {
            res := res + [strings[i]];
            assert strings[i] in strings[..i+1];
            assert |res| <= i + 1;
        }
        i := i + 1;
        assert forall j :: 0 <= j < |res| ==> res[j] in strings[..i];
    }
    assert i == |strings|;
    assert forall s :: s in res ==> s in strings;
}
</answer>

Explanation of added assertions:

1. `assert strings[i] in strings[..i+1];`: This helps Dafny understand that the newly added string is indeed from the original sequence.

2. `assert |res| <= i + 1;`: This helps prove that the length of res remains less than or equal to i after potentially adding a new element.

3. `assert forall j :: 0 <= j < |res| ==> res[j] in strings[..i];`: This helps maintain the invariant about res elements being from the processed part of strings.

4. `assert i == |strings|;`: This helps Dafny realize that we've processed all strings when the loop ends.

5. `assert forall s :: s in res ==> s in strings;`: This directly states the second post-condition, helping Dafny prove it.

These invariants and assertions should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the method according to its post-conditions.

LLM: I apologize for the error. You're right, we can't use a method call in an invariant. Let's modify our approach. Instead of using the `checkSubstring` method in the invariant, we'll maintain a stronger invariant about the relationship between `res` and `strings`.

Here's the corrected version:

<answer>
method checkSubstring(s: string, sub: string) returns (result: bool)
{
    result := false;
    if (|sub| == 0)
    {
        result := true;
    }
    else if (|s| >= |sub|)
    {
        var i: int := 0;
        while (i <= |s| - |sub|)
        {
            if (s[i..i + |sub|] == sub)
            {
                result := true;
            }
            i := i + 1;
        }
    }
}

method filter_by_substring(strings: seq<string>, substring: string) returns (res : seq<string>)
    ensures |res| <= |strings|
    ensures (forall s :: s in res ==> s in strings)
{
    res := [];
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |strings|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |strings|
        invariant |res| <= i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |res| ==> res[j] in strings[..i]
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> 
            (checkSubstring(strings[j], substring) <==> strings[j] in res)
    {
        var check : bool := checkSubstring(strings[i], substring);
        if (check)
        {
            res := res + [strings[i]];
            assert strings[i] in strings[..i+1];
            assert |res| <= i + 1;
        }
        i := i + 1;
        assert forall j :: 0 <= j < |res| ==> res[j] in strings[..i];
    }
    assert i == |strings|;
    assert forall s :: s in res ==> s in strings;
}
</answer>

Explanation of changes:

1. We removed the invariant that used `checkSubstring` directly.

2. We added a new invariant:
   ```
   invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> 
       (checkSubstring(strings[j], substring) <==> strings[j] in res)
   ```
   This invariant states that for all strings we've processed so far, a string is in `res` if and only if `checkSubstring` returns true for it.

3. We kept the other invariants and assertions as they were, as they're still useful for proving the post-conditions.

This modification should resolve the errors while still providing enough information for Dafny to verify the correctness of the method. The new invariant effectively captures the relationship between `checkSubstring` and the contents of `res` without directly calling the method in the invariant.

LLM: I apologize for the persistent error. You're absolutely right, and I made a mistake by still including a method call in the invariant. Let's correct this by removing any reference to the `checkSubstring` method in the invariants. We'll focus on maintaining invariants about the relationship between `res` and `strings` without involving the `checkSubstring` method.

Here's the corrected version:

<answer>
method checkSubstring(s: string, sub: string) returns (result: bool)
{
    result := false;
    if (|sub| == 0)
    {
        result := true;
    }
    else if (|s| >= |sub|)
    {
        var i: int := 0;
        while (i <= |s| - |sub|)
        {
            if (s[i..i + |sub|] == sub)
            {
                result := true;
            }
            i := i + 1;
        }
    }
}

method filter_by_substring(strings: seq<string>, substring: string) returns (res : seq<string>)
    ensures |res| <= |strings|
    ensures (forall s :: s in res ==> s in strings)
{
    res := [];
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |strings|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |strings|
        invariant |res| <= i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |res| ==> res[j] in strings[..i]
    {
        var check : bool := checkSubstring(strings[i], substring);
        if (check)
        {
            res := res + [strings[i]];
            assert strings[i] in strings[..i+1];
            assert |res| <= i + 1;
        }
        i := i + 1;
        assert forall j :: 0 <= j < |res| ==> res[j] in strings[..i];
    }
    assert i == |strings|;
    assert forall s :: s in res ==> s in strings;
}
</answer>

Explanation of changes:

1. We removed all invariants that referenced the `checkSubstring` method.

2. We kept the following invariants which are sufficient to prove the post-conditions:
   ```
   invariant 0 <= i <= |strings|
   invariant |res| <= i
   invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |res| ==> res[j] in strings[..i]
   ```

3. We kept the assertions within the loop body and after the loop, as they help Dafny understand the relationship between `res` and `strings`.

These invariants and assertions should be sufficient for Dafny to verify that:
1. The length of `res` is always less than or equal to the length of `strings`.
2. Every string in `res` is also in `strings`.

The `checkSubstring` method is still used within the loop to determine whether to add a string to `res`, but it's not referenced in any invariants or assertions. This approach should resolve the errors while still allowing Dafny to verify the correctness of the method according to its post-conditions.
