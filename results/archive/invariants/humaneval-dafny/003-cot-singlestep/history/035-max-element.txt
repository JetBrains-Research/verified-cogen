The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method max_element(l : seq<int>) returns (result : int)
    // pre-conditions-start
    requires |l| > 0
    // pre-conditions-end
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |l| ==> l[i] <= result
    ensures exists i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |l| && l[i] == result
    // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    result := l[0];
    var i : int := 1;
    while i < |l|
    {
        if l[i] > result {
            result := l[i];
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `max_element` takes a non-empty sequence of integers as input and returns the maximum element in the sequence.

2. The precondition ensures that the input sequence is not empty.

3. The postconditions ensure that:
   a. The result is greater than or equal to all elements in the sequence.
   b. The result is actually present in the sequence.

4. The implementation uses a loop to iterate through the sequence, updating the `result` variable whenever a larger element is found.

Now, let's add invariants to the loop:

1. We need to ensure that `i` stays within bounds:
   `invariant 1 <= i <= |l|`

2. We need to ensure that `result` is the maximum of all elements seen so far:
   `invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < i ==> l[k] <= result`

3. We need to ensure that `result` is actually an element from the part of the sequence we've seen:
   `invariant exists k :: 0 <= k < i && l[k] == result`

These invariants together will help prove the postconditions.

Now, let's add an assertion after the loop to help Dafny prove the postconditions:

`assert i == |l|;`

This assertion helps Dafny understand that after the loop, we've looked at all elements of the sequence.

Here's the program with the added invariants and assertion:

<answer>
method max_element(l : seq<int>) returns (result : int)
    requires |l| > 0
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |l| ==> l[i] <= result
    ensures exists i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |l| && l[i] == result
{
    result := l[0];
    var i : int := 1;
    while i < |l|
        invariant 1 <= i <= |l|
        invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < i ==> l[k] <= result
        invariant exists k :: 0 <= k < i && l[k] == result
    {
        if l[i] > result {
            result := l[i];
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    assert i == |l|;
}
</answer>

These additions should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the method.
