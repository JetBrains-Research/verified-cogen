The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method filter_by_prefix(xs: seq<string>, p: string) returns (filtered: seq<string>)
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |filtered| ==> starts_with(filtered[i], p)
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  filtered := [];
  var i := 0;
  while i < |xs|
  {
    if starts_with(xs[i], p) {
      filtered := filtered + [xs[i]];
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}
function starts_with(s: string, p: string): bool {
  |p| == 0 || (|s| != 0 && |s| >= |p| && s[0] == p[0] && starts_with(s[1..], p[1..]))
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and determine the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `filter_by_prefix` takes a sequence of strings `xs` and a prefix string `p` as input, and returns a filtered sequence of strings.

2. The post-condition ensures that all strings in the filtered sequence start with the given prefix `p`.

3. The implementation uses a while loop to iterate through the input sequence `xs`, checking each string and adding it to the `filtered` sequence if it starts with the prefix `p`.

4. The `starts_with` function is provided as a helper function to check if a string starts with a given prefix.

To prove the correctness of this method, we need to add invariants to the while loop. Let's consider what properties should hold at each iteration:

1. The loop variable `i` should always be within the bounds of the input sequence `xs`:
   `0 <= i <= |xs|`

2. All elements in the `filtered` sequence so far should start with the prefix `p`:
   `forall j :: 0 <= j < |filtered| ==> starts_with(filtered[j], p)`

3. The `filtered` sequence should contain all the matching elements from `xs` up to index `i-1`:
   `forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> (starts_with(xs[j], p) <==> xs[j] in filtered)`

These invariants should be sufficient to prove the post-condition of the method.

Now, let's add these invariants to the while loop and include an assertion after the loop to help Dafny verify the post-condition:

<answer>
method filter_by_prefix(xs: seq<string>, p: string) returns (filtered: seq<string>)
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |filtered| ==> starts_with(filtered[i], p)
{
  filtered := [];
  var i := 0;
  while i < |xs|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |xs|
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |filtered| ==> starts_with(filtered[j], p)
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> (starts_with(xs[j], p) <==> xs[j] in filtered)
  {
    if starts_with(xs[i], p) {
      filtered := filtered + [xs[i]];
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }

  assert forall j :: 0 <= j < |xs| ==> (starts_with(xs[j], p) <==> xs[j] in filtered);
}

function starts_with(s: string, p: string): bool {
  |p| == 0 || (|s| != 0 && |s| >= |p| && s[0] == p[0] && starts_with(s[1..], p[1..]))
}
</answer>

The added invariants ensure that:
1. The loop variable `i` stays within bounds.
2. All elements in `filtered` start with the prefix `p`.
3. `filtered` contains exactly the matching elements from `xs` up to the current position.

The assertion after the loop helps Dafny verify that the post-condition holds for the entire input sequence `xs`.

These additions should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the method without changing the implementation.
