The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method remove_vowels(text : string) returns (s : string)
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |s| ==> s[i] != 'a' && s[i] != 'e' && s[i] != 'i' && s[i] != 'o' && s[i] != 'u'
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |s| ==> s[i] in text
    ensures forall j : int :: j >= 0 && j < |text| && text[j] != 'a' && text[j] != 'e' && text[j] != 'i' && text[j] != 'o' && text[j] != 'u' ==> text[j] in s
    // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    s := "";
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |text|)
    {
        var c : char := text[i];
        if (c != 'a' && c != 'e' && c != 'i' && c != 'o' && c != 'u')
        {
            s := s + [c];
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add appropriate invariants and assertions:

1. The method `remove_vowels` takes a string `text` as input and returns a string `s` as output.

2. The post-conditions ensure that:
   a. The output string `s` contains no vowels.
   b. All characters in `s` are from the original `text`.
   c. All non-vowel characters from `text` are in `s`.

3. The implementation uses a while loop to iterate through each character of `text`, adding non-vowels to `s`.

Now, let's add invariants to the while loop:

1. We need to ensure that `i` stays within bounds:
   `invariant 0 <= i <= |text|`

2. We need to ensure that `s` maintains the properties specified in the post-conditions for the portion of `text` we've processed so far:
   `invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < |s| ==> s[k] != 'a' && s[k] != 'e' && s[k] != 'i' && s[k] != 'o' && s[k] != 'u'`
   `invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < |s| ==> s[k] in text[..i]`
   `invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < i && text[k] != 'a' && text[k] != 'e' && text[k] != 'i' && text[k] != 'o' && text[k] != 'u' ==> text[k] in s`

3. We can add an assertion after the if statement to help Dafny verify that we're maintaining these properties:
   `assert s == old(s) || s == old(s) + [c];`

Here's the program with these additions:

<answer>
method remove_vowels(text : string) returns (s : string)
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |s| ==> s[i] != 'a' && s[i] != 'e' && s[i] != 'i' && s[i] != 'o' && s[i] != 'u'
    ensures forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |s| ==> s[i] in text
    ensures forall j : int :: j >= 0 && j < |text| && text[j] != 'a' && text[j] != 'e' && text[j] != 'i' && text[j] != 'o' && text[j] != 'u' ==> text[j] in s
{
    s := "";
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |text|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |text|
        invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < |s| ==> s[k] != 'a' && s[k] != 'e' && s[k] != 'i' && s[k] != 'o' && s[k] != 'u'
        invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < |s| ==> s[k] in text[..i]
        invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < i && text[k] != 'a' && text[k] != 'e' && text[k] != 'i' && text[k] != 'o' && text[k] != 'u' ==> text[k] in s
    {
        var c : char := text[i];
        if (c != 'a' && c != 'e' && c != 'i' && c != 'o' && c != 'u')
        {
            s := s + [c];
        }
        assert s == old(s) || s == old(s) + [c];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

These additions should help Dafny verify that the implementation meets the specified post-conditions.
