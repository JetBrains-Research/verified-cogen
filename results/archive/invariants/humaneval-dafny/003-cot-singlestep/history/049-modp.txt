The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
function modp_rec(n: int, p: int): int
  requires p > 0
  requires n >= 0
{
    if n == 0 then 1 % p else (modp_rec(n - 1, p) * 2) % p
}
method modp(n: int, p: int) returns (r: int)
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires p > 0
  requires n >= 0
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures r == modp_rec(n, p)
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  r := 1 % p;
  var i := 0;
  while i < n
  {
    r := (r * 2) % p;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program step by step:

1. The function `modp_rec` is a recursive function that calculates (2^n) mod p. It does this by multiplying the result of the previous step by 2 and then taking the modulus with p.

2. The method `modp` is an iterative implementation of the same calculation. It starts with 1 (which is 2^0) and then multiplies by 2 and takes the modulus p, n times.

To prove that the iterative method `modp` is equivalent to the recursive function `modp_rec`, we need to add some invariants and assertions. Here's the reasoning:

1. We need a loop invariant that relates the current value of `r` to `modp_rec(i, p)`. This invariant should be: `r == modp_rec(i, p)`.

2. We also need to ensure that `i` stays within bounds, so we'll add the invariant: `0 <= i <= n`.

3. To prove that these invariants hold, we need to show that if `r == modp_rec(i, p)`, then after one iteration, `(r * 2) % p == modp_rec(i + 1, p)`. We can do this by adding an assertion and using the definition of `modp_rec`.

4. We should also assert that `p > 0` inside the loop to help Dafny with the modulus operation.

Here's the program with the added invariants and assertions:

<answer>
function modp_rec(n: int, p: int): int
  requires p > 0
  requires n >= 0
{
    if n == 0 then 1 % p else (modp_rec(n - 1, p) * 2) % p
}

method modp(n: int, p: int) returns (r: int)
  requires p > 0
  requires n >= 0
  ensures r == modp_rec(n, p)
{
  r := 1 % p;
  var i := 0;
  while i < n
    invariant 0 <= i <= n
    invariant r == modp_rec(i, p)
  {
    assert p > 0;
    assert r == modp_rec(i, p);
    r := (r * 2) % p;
    assert r == (modp_rec(i, p) * 2) % p;
    assert r == modp_rec(i + 1, p);
    i := i + 1;
  }
}
</answer>

In this modified version:

1. We've added two invariants to the while loop: `0 <= i <= n` and `r == modp_rec(i, p)`.

2. Inside the loop, we've added several assertions:
   - `assert p > 0;` to help Dafny with the modulus operation.
   - `assert r == modp_rec(i, p);` to restate the loop invariant.
   - `assert r == (modp_rec(i, p) * 2) % p;` after updating `r`.
   - `assert r == modp_rec(i + 1, p);` to show that the new value of `r` matches the recursive definition for the next step.

These additions should help Dafny verify that the iterative implementation in `modp` is equivalent to the recursive function `modp_rec`.
