The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
function rot_sym(c: char): char
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires 'a' <= c <= 'z'
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures 'a' <= rot_sym(c) <= 'z'
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  var alph := c as int - 'a' as int;
  ((alph + 2 * 2) % 26 + 'a' as int) as char
  // impl-end
}
method encrypt(s: string) returns (r: string)
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> 'a' <= s[i] <= 'z'
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures |r| == |s|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> r[i] == rot_sym(s[i])
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  r := "";
  var i := 0;
  while i < |s|
  {
    r := r + [rot_sym(s[i])];
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}
method Main() {
    var s := "asdfghjkl";
    var r := encrypt(s);
    assert r == "ewhjklnop";
}


LLM: Let's analyze the program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The `rot_sym` function:
   - It takes a character `c` and returns another character.
   - The precondition ensures that the input is a lowercase letter.
   - The postcondition ensures that the output is also a lowercase letter.
   - The implementation rotates the letter by 4 positions in the alphabet (wrapping around if necessary).

2. The `encrypt` method:
   - It takes a string `s` and returns a string `r`.
   - The precondition ensures that all characters in `s` are lowercase letters.
   - The postconditions ensure that:
     a) The length of the output is the same as the input.
     b) Each character in the output is the result of applying `rot_sym` to the corresponding character in the input.

3. The `Main` method:
   - It provides a test case for the `encrypt` method.

Now, let's add invariants to the `encrypt` method:

1. We need to ensure that the loop variable `i` stays within bounds:
   `invariant 0 <= i <= |s|`

2. We need to ensure that the length of `r` is always equal to `i`:
   `invariant |r| == i`

3. We need to ensure that all characters processed so far have been correctly encrypted:
   `invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> r[j] == rot_sym(s[j])`

Let's also add an assertion after the loop to help Dafny prove the postconditions:
`assert i == |s|;`

Here's the program with the added invariants and assertions:

<answer>
function rot_sym(c: char): char
  requires 'a' <= c <= 'z'
  ensures 'a' <= rot_sym(c) <= 'z'
{
  var alph := c as int - 'a' as int;
  ((alph + 2 * 2) % 26 + 'a' as int) as char
}

method encrypt(s: string) returns (r: string)
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> 'a' <= s[i] <= 'z'
  ensures |r| == |s|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> r[i] == rot_sym(s[i])
{
  r := "";
  var i := 0;
  while i < |s|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
    invariant |r| == i
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> r[j] == rot_sym(s[j])
  {
    r := r + [rot_sym(s[i])];
    i := i + 1;
  }
  assert i == |s|;
}

method Main() {
    var s := "asdfghjkl";
    var r := encrypt(s);
    assert r == "ewhjklnop";
}
</answer>

These invariants and assertions should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the `encrypt` method. The invariants ensure that at each iteration of the loop, we maintain the necessary properties, and the final assertion helps Dafny connect the loop invariants to the method's postconditions.
