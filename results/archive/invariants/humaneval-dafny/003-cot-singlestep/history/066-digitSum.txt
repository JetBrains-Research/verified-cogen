The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
function upper_sum_rec(s: string): int
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures upper_sum_rec(s) >= 0
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  if |s| == 0 then
    0
  else
    var remaining := upper_sum_rec(s[1..]);
    to_int(s[0]) + remaining
  // impl-end
}
lemma upper_sum_rec_prop(s: string)
  requires |s| > 0
  ensures upper_sum_rec(s) == upper_sum_rec(s[..|s|-1]) + to_int(s[|s|-1])
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
function to_int(c: char): int
    ensures 'A' <= c <= 'Z' ==> to_int(c) == c as int
    ensures c < 'A' || c > 'Z' ==> to_int(c) == 0
{
    if 'A' <= c <= 'Z' then c as int else 0
}
method upper_sum(s: string) returns (res: int)
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures res == upper_sum_rec(s)
    // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    res := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |s|)
    {
        res := res + to_int(s[i]);
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The `upper_sum_rec` function is a recursive implementation that sums the ASCII values of uppercase letters in a string. It already has a post-condition ensuring the result is non-negative.

2. The `upper_sum_rec_prop` lemma states that for a non-empty string, the sum of the whole string is equal to the sum of all but the last character plus the value of the last character.

3. The `to_int` function converts a character to its ASCII value if it's an uppercase letter, or to 0 otherwise.

4. The `upper_sum` method is an iterative implementation that should produce the same result as `upper_sum_rec`. We need to prove this equivalence.

To prove the correctness of `upper_sum`, we need to add invariants to the while loop:

1. We need to ensure that `i` stays within bounds: `0 <= i <= |s|`
2. We need to show that at each step, `res` is equal to the sum of the processed part of the string: `res == upper_sum_rec(s[..i])`

We'll also need to use the `upper_sum_rec_prop` lemma to prove that adding `to_int(s[i])` to `res` is equivalent to extending the processed part of the string.

Here's the program with added invariants and assertions:

<answer>
function upper_sum_rec(s: string): int
  ensures upper_sum_rec(s) >= 0
{
  if |s| == 0 then
    0
  else
    var remaining := upper_sum_rec(s[1..]);
    to_int(s[0]) + remaining
}

lemma upper_sum_rec_prop(s: string)
  requires |s| > 0
  ensures upper_sum_rec(s) == upper_sum_rec(s[..|s|-1]) + to_int(s[|s|-1])
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}

function to_int(c: char): int
    ensures 'A' <= c <= 'Z' ==> to_int(c) == c as int
    ensures c < 'A' || c > 'Z' ==> to_int(c) == 0
{
    if 'A' <= c <= 'Z' then c as int else 0
}

method upper_sum(s: string) returns (res: int)
    ensures res == upper_sum_rec(s)
{
    res := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |s|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
        invariant res == upper_sum_rec(s[..i])
    {
        assert s[..i+1] == s[..i] + [s[i]];
        upper_sum_rec_prop(s[..i+1]);
        assert upper_sum_rec(s[..i+1]) == upper_sum_rec(s[..i]) + to_int(s[i]);

        res := res + to_int(s[i]);
        i := i + 1;
    }

    assert s[..i] == s;
}
</answer>

Explanation of the added invariants and assertions:

1. In the while loop, we added two invariants:
   - `0 <= i <= |s|`: This ensures that `i` stays within the bounds of the string.
   - `res == upper_sum_rec(s[..i])`: This maintains that `res` always equals the sum of the processed part of the string.

2. Inside the loop body, we added assertions to help Dafny prove the correctness:
   - `assert s[..i+1] == s[..i] + [s[i]]`: This shows that extending the processed part of the string is equivalent to adding the next character.
   - We call `upper_sum_rec_prop(s[..i+1])` to use the lemma.
   - `assert upper_sum_rec(s[..i+1]) == upper_sum_rec(s[..i]) + to_int(s[i])`: This shows that the sum of the extended string is equal to the sum of the previous part plus the value of the new character.

3. After the loop, we add `assert s[..i] == s` to show that we've processed the entire string.

These additions should be sufficient for Dafny to prove that the `upper_sum` method correctly implements the `upper_sum_rec` function.
