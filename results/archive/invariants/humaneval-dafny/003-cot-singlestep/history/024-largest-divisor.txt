The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
method largest_divisor(n: int) returns (d : int)
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires n > 1
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures 1 <= d < n
  ensures n % d == 0
  ensures forall k :: d < k < n ==> n % k != 0
  // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    d := n - 1;
    while (d >= 1)
    {
        if (n % d == 0) {
            return d;
        }
        d := d - 1;
    }
    return 1;
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `largest_divisor` takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer `d`.

2. The precondition requires that `n > 1`.

3. The postconditions ensure that:
   a. `1 <= d < n`
   b. `n % d == 0` (d is a divisor of n)
   c. For all k between d and n, k is not a divisor of n.

4. The implementation starts with `d = n - 1` and decrements d until it finds a divisor or reaches 1.

Now, let's add invariants to the while loop:

1. We need to ensure that `d` stays within the correct range:
   `invariant 1 <= d < n`

2. We need to ensure that we haven't missed any divisors larger than the current `d`:
   `invariant forall k :: d < k < n ==> n % k != 0`

3. We need to ensure that the loop terminates:
   `decreases d`

Now, let's add some assertions to help prove the postconditions:

1. Before returning `d`, we should assert that it's a divisor of `n`:
   `assert n % d == 0;`

2. After the loop (before returning 1), we should assert that we've checked all possible divisors:
   `assert forall k :: 1 < k < n ==> n % k != 0;`

Here's the program with these additions:

<answer>
method largest_divisor(n: int) returns (d : int)
  requires n > 1
  ensures 1 <= d < n
  ensures n % d == 0
  ensures forall k :: d < k < n ==> n % k != 0
{
    d := n - 1;
    while (d >= 1)
      invariant 1 <= d < n
      invariant forall k :: d < k < n ==> n % k != 0
      decreases d
    {
        if (n % d == 0) {
            assert n % d == 0;
            return d;
        }
        d := d - 1;
    }
    assert forall k :: 1 < k < n ==> n % k != 0;
    return 1;
}
</answer>

This version of the program should now be verifiable by Dafny. The invariants ensure that the loop maintains the necessary properties, and the assertions help Dafny prove that the postconditions are met. The `decreases d` clause helps Dafny prove that the loop terminates.
