The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
function tri(n: nat): nat
  decreases if n % 2 == 0 then 0 else n
{
  if n == 1 then 3
  else if n % 2 == 0 then 1 + n / 2
  else tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)
}
method Tribonacci(n: nat) returns (result: seq<nat>)
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures |result| == n + 1
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i <= n ==> result[i] == tri(i)
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  if n == 0 {
    result := [1];
  } else {
    result := [1, 3];
    var i := 2;
    while i <= n
    {
      if i % 2 == 0 {
        result := result + [1 + i / 2];
      } else {
        result := result + [result[i - 2] + result[i - 1] + (i + 3) / 2];
      }
      i := i + 1;
    }
  }
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program step by step:

1. The `tri` function calculates the nth Tribonacci number recursively. It has a complex decreases clause to ensure termination.

2. The `Tribonacci` method is supposed to return a sequence of Tribonacci numbers from 0 to n.

3. The post-conditions ensure that the result has the correct length and that each element is the correct Tribonacci number.

Now, let's think about the invariants we need for the while loop:

1. We need to ensure that `i` stays within bounds: `2 <= i <= n + 1`

2. We need to ensure that the length of `result` is correct at each iteration: `|result| == i`

3. We need to ensure that all elements calculated so far are correct: `forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] == tri(j)`

Let's add these invariants to the while loop. We'll also add some assertions to help Dafny verify the code:

<answer>
function tri(n: nat): nat
  decreases if n % 2 == 0 then 0 else n
{
  if n == 1 then 3
  else if n % 2 == 0 then 1 + n / 2
  else tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)
}

method Tribonacci(n: nat) returns (result: seq<nat>)
  ensures |result| == n + 1
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i <= n ==> result[i] == tri(i)
{
  if n == 0 {
    result := [1];
    assert result[0] == tri(0);
  } else {
    result := [1, 3];
    assert result[0] == tri(0);
    assert result[1] == tri(1);
    var i := 2;
    while i <= n
      invariant 2 <= i <= n + 1
      invariant |result| == i
      invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] == tri(j)
    {
      if i % 2 == 0 {
        result := result + [1 + i / 2];
        assert result[i] == tri(i);
      } else {
        assert result[i-2] == tri(i-2);
        assert result[i-1] == tri(i-1);
        assert (i + 3) / 2 == tri(i+1);
        result := result + [result[i - 2] + result[i - 1] + (i + 3) / 2];
        assert result[i] == tri(i-2) + tri(i-1) + tri(i+1);
        assert result[i] == tri(i);
      }
      i := i + 1;
    }
  }
}
</answer>

In this solution, we've added the three invariants to the while loop as discussed. We've also added several assertions:

1. In the base case (n == 0), we assert that the first (and only) element is correct.

2. In the else case, before the loop, we assert that the first two elements are correct.

3. Inside the loop, for the even case, we assert that the newly added element is correct.

4. For the odd case, we add several assertions:
   - The (i-2)th and (i-1)th elements are correct (from the loop invariant)
   - (i + 3) / 2 is indeed tri(i+1) for odd i
   - The newly calculated element is the sum of tri(i-2), tri(i-1), and tri(i+1)
   - This sum is indeed tri(i) for odd i

These assertions help Dafny verify that the implementation correctly follows the recursive definition of the Tribonacci sequence.
