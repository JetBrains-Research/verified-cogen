The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method Compare(scores: array<int>, guesses: array<int>) returns (result: array<int>)
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires scores.Length == guesses.Length
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures result.Length == scores.Length
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < result.Length ==> result[i] == abs(scores[i] - guesses[i])
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  result := new int[scores.Length];
  var i := 0;
  while i < scores.Length
  {
    result[i] := abs(scores[i] - guesses[i]);
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}
function abs(x: int): int
    ensures 0 <= abs(x)
{
  if x < 0 then -x else x
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `Compare` takes two arrays of integers (`scores` and `guesses`) and returns a new array (`result`).

2. The precondition ensures that both input arrays have the same length.

3. The postconditions ensure that:
   a. The resulting array has the same length as the input arrays.
   b. Each element in the result array is the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in `scores` and `guesses`.

4. The implementation creates a new array of the same length as the input arrays, then uses a while loop to populate it with the absolute differences.

5. The `abs` function is provided to calculate the absolute value of an integer.

To prove the correctness of this method, we need to add invariants to the while loop. The invariants should capture:

1. The loop index `i` is within the valid range.
2. The elements of the result array that have been filled so far satisfy the postcondition.

We'll also add an assertion after the loop to help Dafny prove the postcondition about all elements in the result array.

Here's the program with added invariants and assertions:

<answer>
method Compare(scores: array<int>, guesses: array<int>) returns (result: array<int>)
  requires scores.Length == guesses.Length
  ensures result.Length == scores.Length
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < result.Length ==> result[i] == abs(scores[i] - guesses[i])
{
  result := new int[scores.Length];
  var i := 0;
  while i < scores.Length
    invariant 0 <= i <= scores.Length
    invariant result.Length == scores.Length
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] == abs(scores[j] - guesses[j])
  {
    result[i] := abs(scores[i] - guesses[i]);
    i := i + 1;
  }

  assert i == scores.Length;
  assert forall j :: 0 <= j < scores.Length ==> result[j] == abs(scores[j] - guesses[j]);
}

function abs(x: int): int
    ensures 0 <= abs(x)
{
  if x < 0 then -x else x
}
</answer>

Explanation of the added invariants and assertions:

1. `invariant 0 <= i <= scores.Length`: This ensures that the loop index `i` stays within the valid range. It's always non-negative and never exceeds the length of the arrays.

2. `invariant result.Length == scores.Length`: This maintains the fact that the result array has the same length as the input arrays throughout the loop execution.

3. `invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] == abs(scores[j] - guesses[j])`: This captures the fact that all elements of the result array up to (but not including) index `i` have been correctly computed.

4. The assertion `assert i == scores.Length` after the loop helps Dafny understand that the loop has completed and `i` is equal to the length of the arrays.

5. The final assertion `assert forall j :: 0 <= j < scores.Length ==> result[j] == abs(scores[j] - guesses[j])` helps Dafny prove the postcondition about all elements in the result array.

These invariants and assertions should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the `Compare` method.
