The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
function fib(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 0
  else if n == 1 then 1
  else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}
method ComputeFib(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures result == fib(n)
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  if n == 0 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 1 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b := 0, 1;
  var i := 2;
  while i <= n
  {
    var temp := a + b;
    a := b;
    b := temp;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  return b;
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The `fib` function is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. It's correctly defined with a decreases clause to ensure termination.

2. The `ComputeFib` method is an iterative implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. It aims to compute the nth Fibonacci number.

3. The post-condition `ensures result == fib(n)` states that the result of `ComputeFib` should be equal to the nth Fibonacci number as computed by the `fib` function.

To prove the correctness of `ComputeFib`, we need to add invariants to the while loop. The invariants should capture the following properties:

1. The loop counter `i` is always between 2 and n+1 (inclusive).
2. At each iteration, `a` represents the (i-2)th Fibonacci number, and `b` represents the (i-1)th Fibonacci number.

We can express these invariants as follows:

```dafny
invariant 2 <= i <= n + 1
invariant a == fib(i - 2)
invariant b == fib(i - 1)
```

Additionally, we can add an assertion after the loop to help Dafny verify that `b` is indeed the nth Fibonacci number:

```dafny
assert i == n + 1 && b == fib(n);
```

Now, let's put it all together:

<answer>
function fib(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 0
  else if n == 1 then 1
  else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}

method ComputeFib(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
  ensures result == fib(n)
{
  if n == 0 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 1 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b := 0, 1;
  var i := 2;
  while i <= n
    invariant 2 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant a == fib(i - 2)
    invariant b == fib(i - 1)
  {
    var temp := a + b;
    a := b;
    b := temp;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  assert i == n + 1 && b == fib(n);
  return b;
}
</answer>

These invariants and the assertion help Dafny verify that the iterative implementation in `ComputeFib` correctly computes the nth Fibonacci number, matching the recursive definition in the `fib` function. The invariants maintain the relationship between the loop counter `i` and the Fibonacci sequence values stored in `a` and `b`. The final assertion confirms that when the loop terminates, `b` holds the correct nth Fibonacci number.
