The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
method find_max(strings : seq<string>) returns (s : string)
   // pre-conditions-start
    requires |strings| > 0
    // pre-conditions-end
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures s in strings
    ensures forall i : int :: 0 <= i < |strings| ==> |set c | c in s| >= |set c | c in strings[i]|
    // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    s := strings[0];
    var i := 1;
    while i < |strings|
    {
        if (|set c | c in s| < |set c | c in strings[i]|) {
            s := strings[i];
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `find_max` takes a sequence of strings as input and returns a single string.

2. The precondition requires that the input sequence is not empty.

3. The postconditions ensure that:
   a. The returned string is in the input sequence.
   b. The returned string has the maximum number of unique characters among all strings in the sequence.

4. The implementation iterates through the sequence, updating `s` whenever it finds a string with more unique characters.

Now, let's add invariants to the while loop:

1. We need to ensure that `i` stays within bounds:
   `invariant 1 <= i <= |strings|`

2. We need to ensure that `s` is always a string from the input sequence:
   `invariant s in strings`

3. We need to ensure that `s` has the maximum number of unique characters among all strings checked so far:
   `invariant forall j : int :: 0 <= j < i ==> |set c | c in s| >= |set c | c in strings[j]|`

4. We should also add an invariant to maintain that `s` is initialized:
   `invariant s == strings[0] || s in strings[1..i]`

Now, let's add these invariants and some helpful assertions:

<answer>
method find_max(strings : seq<string>) returns (s : string)
    requires |strings| > 0
    ensures s in strings
    ensures forall i : int :: 0 <= i < |strings| ==> |set c | c in s| >= |set c | c in strings[i]|
{
    s := strings[0];
    var i := 1;
    while i < |strings|
        invariant 1 <= i <= |strings|
        invariant s in strings
        invariant s == strings[0] || s in strings[1..i]
        invariant forall j : int :: 0 <= j < i ==> |set c | c in s| >= |set c | c in strings[j]|
    {
        assert s in strings[..i];
        if (|set c | c in s| < |set c | c in strings[i]|) {
            s := strings[i];
        }
        assert |set c | c in s| >= |set c | c in strings[i]|;
        i := i + 1;
    }
    assert i == |strings|;
}
</answer>

Explanation of added assertions:

1. `assert s in strings[..i];` - This helps Dafny understand that `s` is either the initial string or one of the strings we've checked so far.

2. `assert |set c | c in s| >= |set c | c in strings[i]|;` - This assertion helps Dafny verify that after each iteration, `s` still has the maximum number of unique characters among all strings checked so far.

3. `assert i == |strings|;` - This helps Dafny understand that we've checked all strings when the loop ends.

These invariants and assertions should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the implementation with respect to the given specifications.
