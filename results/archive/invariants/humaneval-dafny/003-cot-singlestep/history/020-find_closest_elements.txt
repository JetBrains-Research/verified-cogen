The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
function dist(a: real, b: real) : (d : real)
    ensures d >= 0.0
    ensures (d == 0.0) <==> a == b
    {
        if a < b then b - a else a - b
    }
// distinct elements
function des(s: seq<real>, a: int, b: int) : bool {
    0 <= a < |s| && 0 <= b < |s| && a != b
}
method find_closest_elements(s: seq<real>) returns (l : real, h : real)
    // pre-conditions-start
    requires |s| >= 2
    // pre-conditions-end
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures exists a, b : int :: des(s, a, b) && l == s[a] && h == s[b]
    ensures forall a, b : int :: des(s, a, b) ==> dist(l, h) <= dist(s[a], s[b])
    ensures l <= h
    // post-conditions-end
    {
        // impl-start
        l := s[0];
        h := s[1];
        var d : real := dist(l, h);
        var i : int := 0;
        while (i < |s|)
        {
            var j : int := i + 1;
            while (j < |s|)
            {
                if dist(s[i], s[j]) <= d {
                    l := s[i];
                    h := s[j];
                    d := dist(l, h);
                }
                j := j + 1;
            }
            i := i + 1;
        }
        if (l <= h) {
            return l, h;
        } else {
            return h, l;
        }
        // impl-end
    }


LLM: Let's analyze the program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The `dist` function calculates the absolute difference between two real numbers.

2. The `des` function checks if two indices are distinct and valid for a given sequence.

3. The `find_closest_elements` method finds the two closest elements in a sequence of real numbers.

Now, let's add invariants and assertions:

1. For the outer while loop:
   - We need to ensure that `i` stays within bounds.
   - We need to maintain that `l` and `h` are valid elements from the sequence.
   - We need to ensure that `d` is the distance between `l` and `h`.
   - We need to maintain that `l` and `h` are the closest pair found so far.

2. For the inner while loop:
   - We need to ensure that `j` stays within bounds and is greater than `i`.
   - We need to maintain the invariants from the outer loop.

3. We should add an assertion before the final if statement to ensure that `l` and `h` are distinct elements from the sequence.

Here's the program with added invariants and assertions:

<answer>
function dist(a: real, b: real) : (d : real)
    ensures d >= 0.0
    ensures (d == 0.0) <==> a == b
    {
        if a < b then b - a else a - b
    }

function des(s: seq<real>, a: int, b: int) : bool {
    0 <= a < |s| && 0 <= b < |s| && a != b
}

method find_closest_elements(s: seq<real>) returns (l : real, h : real)
    requires |s| >= 2
    ensures exists a, b : int :: des(s, a, b) && l == s[a] && h == s[b]
    ensures forall a, b : int :: des(s, a, b) ==> dist(l, h) <= dist(s[a], s[b])
    ensures l <= h
{
    l := s[0];
    h := s[1];
    var d : real := dist(l, h);
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |s|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
        invariant exists a, b : int :: des(s, a, b) && l == s[a] && h == s[b]
        invariant d == dist(l, h)
        invariant forall a, b : int :: 0 <= a < i && a < b < |s| ==> dist(l, h) <= dist(s[a], s[b])
    {
        var j : int := i + 1;
        while (j < |s|)
            invariant i + 1 <= j <= |s|
            invariant exists a, b : int :: des(s, a, b) && l == s[a] && h == s[b]
            invariant d == dist(l, h)
            invariant forall a, b : int :: 0 <= a < i && a < b < |s| ==> dist(l, h) <= dist(s[a], s[b])
            invariant forall b : int :: i < b < j ==> dist(l, h) <= dist(s[i], s[b])
        {
            if dist(s[i], s[j]) <= d {
                l := s[i];
                h := s[j];
                d := dist(l, h);
            }
            j := j + 1;
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }

    assert exists a, b : int :: des(s, a, b) && l == s[a] && h == s[b];

    if (l <= h) {
        return l, h;
    } else {
        return h, l;
    }
}
</answer>

These invariants and assertions help Dafny verify that the method satisfies its postconditions. The outer loop invariant ensures that we've checked all pairs up to index i. The inner loop invariant ensures that we've checked all pairs with the first element at index i and the second element up to index j. The final assertion confirms that l and h are distinct elements from the sequence before we potentially swap them to ensure l <= h.
