The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method is_prime(k: int) returns (result: bool)
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires k >= 2
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures result ==> forall i :: 2 <= i < k ==> k % i != 0
  ensures !result ==> exists j :: 2 <= j < k && k % j == 0
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  var i := 2;
  result := true;
  while i < k
  {
    if k % i == 0 {
      result := false;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `is_prime` takes an integer `k` as input and returns a boolean `result`.

2. The precondition requires that `k >= 2`, which is correct as prime numbers are defined only for integers greater than 1.

3. The postconditions ensure that:
   a) If `result` is true, then `k` is not divisible by any integer from 2 to k-1.
   b) If `result` is false, then there exists at least one integer j between 2 and k-1 that divides `k`.

4. The implementation uses a loop to check divisibility of `k` by all integers from 2 to k-1.

Now, let's add invariants and assertions:

1. Loop Invariants:
   a) `2 <= i <= k`: This ensures that `i` stays within the required range.
   b) `result == forall j :: 2 <= j < i ==> k % j != 0`: This maintains the property that `result` is true if and only if `k` is not divisible by any number checked so far.

2. Assertions:
   We can add an assertion after the if statement to clarify why `result` is set to false.

Here's the program with added invariants and assertions:

<answer>
method is_prime(k: int) returns (result: bool)
  requires k >= 2
  ensures result ==> forall i :: 2 <= i < k ==> k % i != 0
  ensures !result ==> exists j :: 2 <= j < k && k % j == 0
{
  var i := 2;
  result := true;
  while i < k
    invariant 2 <= i <= k
    invariant result == forall j :: 2 <= j < i ==> k % j != 0
  {
    if k % i == 0 {
      result := false;
      assert k % i == 0 && 2 <= i < k;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
}
</answer>

Explanation of the additions:

1. The first invariant `2 <= i <= k` ensures that `i` stays within the correct range throughout the loop. This is necessary because the postcondition refers to the range 2 <= i < k.

2. The second invariant `result == forall j :: 2 <= j < i ==> k % j != 0` maintains the property that `result` is true if and only if `k` is not divisible by any number checked so far. This directly relates to the postconditions.

3. The assertion `assert k % i == 0 && 2 <= i < k;` is added after setting `result` to false. This assertion helps Dafny understand why `result` is set to false and how it relates to the postcondition for the case when `result` is false.

These additions should help Dafny verify the correctness of the implementation with respect to the given specifications.
