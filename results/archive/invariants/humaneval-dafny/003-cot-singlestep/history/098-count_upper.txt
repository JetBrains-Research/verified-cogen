The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method count_upper(s: string) returns (cnt: int)
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures cnt == |set i | 0 <= i < |s| && i % 2 == 0 && is_upper_vowel(s[i])|
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  ghost var found := {};
  cnt := 0;
  var i := 0;
  while i < |s|
  {
    if is_upper_vowel(s[i]) && i % 2 == 0 {
      cnt := cnt + 1;
      found := found + {i};
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}
predicate is_upper_vowel(c: char) {
  c == 'A' || c == 'E' || c == 'U' || c == 'I' || c == 'O'
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `count_upper` takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer `cnt`.

2. The postcondition ensures that `cnt` is equal to the number of uppercase vowels at even indices in the string.

3. The implementation uses a loop to iterate through the string, counting uppercase vowels at even indices.

4. A ghost variable `found` is used to keep track of the indices where uppercase vowels are found.

Now, let's add invariants and assertions:

1. Loop invariants:
   a. `0 <= i <= |s|`: This ensures that `i` stays within the bounds of the string.
   b. `cnt == |found|`: This ensures that the count matches the number of indices in the `found` set.
   c. `found == set j | 0 <= j < i && j % 2 == 0 && is_upper_vowel(s[j])`: This ensures that `found` contains all the indices of uppercase vowels at even positions up to `i`.

2. Assertions:
   We can add an assertion before incrementing `cnt` to explicitly state that the current index satisfies the conditions for counting.

Here's the rewritten program with invariants and assertions:

<answer>
method count_upper(s: string) returns (cnt: int)
  ensures cnt == |set i | 0 <= i < |s| && i % 2 == 0 && is_upper_vowel(s[i])|
{
  ghost var found := {};
  cnt := 0;
  var i := 0;
  while i < |s|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
    invariant cnt == |found|
    invariant found == set j | 0 <= j < i && j % 2 == 0 && is_upper_vowel(s[j])
  {
    if is_upper_vowel(s[i]) && i % 2 == 0 {
      assert 0 <= i < |s| && i % 2 == 0 && is_upper_vowel(s[i]);
      cnt := cnt + 1;
      found := found + {i};
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
}

predicate is_upper_vowel(c: char) {
  c == 'A' || c == 'E' || c == 'U' || c == 'I' || c == 'O'
}
</answer>

Explanation of the added invariants and assertions:

1. `invariant 0 <= i <= |s|`: This ensures that `i` stays within the bounds of the string throughout the loop.

2. `invariant cnt == |found|`: This maintains the relationship between the count and the size of the `found` set.

3. `invariant found == set j | 0 <= j < i && j % 2 == 0 && is_upper_vowel(s[j])`: This defines what should be in the `found` set at each iteration of the loop. It helps Dafny understand how `found` relates to the postcondition.

4. `assert 0 <= i < |s| && i % 2 == 0 && is_upper_vowel(s[i])`: This assertion explicitly states the conditions that are true when we're about to increment `cnt` and add to `found`. It helps Dafny connect the loop body to the invariants and postcondition.

These additions should help Dafny verify that the implementation correctly satisfies the postcondition.
