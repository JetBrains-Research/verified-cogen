The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
predicate IsSubstring(s: string, sub: string)
{
  |s| >= |sub| && exists i {:trigger s[i..i+|sub|]} :: 0 <= i <= |s| - |sub| && s[i..i+|sub|] == sub
}
function RotateString(s: string, n: nat): string
  requires 0 <= n <= |s|
{
  s[n..] + s[..n]
}
method CycpatternCheck(word: string, pattern: string) returns (result: bool)
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures result ==> exists i :: 0 <= i <= |pattern| && IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, i))
  ensures !result ==> forall i :: 0 <= i <= |pattern| ==> !IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, i))
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  var i := 0;
  while i <= |pattern|
  {
    if IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, i)) {
      return true;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  return false;
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The `IsSubstring` predicate checks if `sub` is a substring of `s`.

2. The `RotateString` function rotates a string `s` by `n` positions.

3. The `CycpatternCheck` method checks if any rotation of `pattern` is a substring of `word`.

Now, let's focus on the `CycpatternCheck` method and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. We need a loop invariant to maintain the relationship between `i` and `|pattern|`:
   ```dafny
   invariant 0 <= i <= |pattern| + 1
   ```
   This invariant ensures that `i` stays within the valid range throughout the loop.

2. We need an invariant to capture the fact that no rotation of `pattern` up to `i-1` is a substring of `word`:
   ```dafny
   invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> !IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, j))
   ```
   This invariant helps prove the second post-condition when the method returns false.

3. We can add an assertion before returning true to help Dafny prove the first post-condition:
   ```dafny
   assert IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, i));
   assert exists j :: 0 <= j <= |pattern| && IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, j));
   ```

4. We can add an assertion after the loop to help Dafny prove the second post-condition:
   ```dafny
   assert i == |pattern| + 1;
   assert forall j :: 0 <= j <= |pattern| ==> !IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, j));
   ```

Now, let's put it all together:

<answer>
predicate IsSubstring(s: string, sub: string)
{
  |s| >= |sub| && exists i {:trigger s[i..i+|sub|]} :: 0 <= i <= |s| - |sub| && s[i..i+|sub|] == sub
}

function RotateString(s: string, n: nat): string
  requires 0 <= n <= |s|
{
  s[n..] + s[..n]
}

method CycpatternCheck(word: string, pattern: string) returns (result: bool)
  ensures result ==> exists i :: 0 <= i <= |pattern| && IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, i))
  ensures !result ==> forall i :: 0 <= i <= |pattern| ==> !IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, i))
{
  var i := 0;
  while i <= |pattern|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |pattern| + 1
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> !IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, j))
  {
    if IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, i)) {
      assert IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, i));
      assert exists j :: 0 <= j <= |pattern| && IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, j));
      return true;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  assert i == |pattern| + 1;
  assert forall j :: 0 <= j <= |pattern| ==> !IsSubstring(word, RotateString(pattern, j));
  return false;
}
</answer>

These additions should help Dafny verify the correctness of the `CycpatternCheck` method according to its post-conditions.
