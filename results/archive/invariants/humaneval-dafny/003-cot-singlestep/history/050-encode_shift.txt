The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

LLM: Let's analyze the program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The `encode_char` and `decode_char` functions are already well-defined with pre and post-conditions.

2. For the `encode_shift` method:
   - We need to ensure that the loop invariant maintains the length relationship between `s` and `t`.
   - We also need to ensure that all characters processed so far are correctly encoded.
   - The loop counter `i` should be within bounds.

3. For the `decode_shift` method:
   - Similar invariants as `encode_shift`, but for decoding.

Let's add these invariants and some helpful assertions:

<answer>
function encode_char(c: char): char
  requires 'a' <= c <= 'z'
  ensures 'a' <= encode_char(c) <= 'z'
{
  ((c as int - 'a' as int + 5) % 26 + 'a' as int) as char
}

function decode_char(c: char): char
  requires 'a' <= c <= 'z'
  ensures 'a' <= decode_char(c) <= 'z'
  ensures encode_char(decode_char(c)) == c
{
  ((c as int - 'a' as int - 5) % 26 + 'a' as int) as char
}

method encode_shift(s: string) returns (t: string)
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> 'a' <= s[i] <= 'z'
  ensures |s| == |t|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> t[i] == encode_char(s[i])
{
  t := "";
  var i := 0;
  while i < |s|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
    invariant |t| == i
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> t[j] == encode_char(s[j])
  {
    t := t + [encode_char(s[i])];
    assert |t| == i + 1;
    assert t[i] == encode_char(s[i]);
    i := i + 1;
  }
  assert i == |s|;
}

method decode_shift(s: string) returns (t: string)
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> 'a' <= s[i] <= 'z'
  ensures |s| == |t|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> t[i] == decode_char(s[i])
{
  t := "";
  var i := 0;
  while i < |s|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
    invariant |t| == i
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> t[j] == decode_char(s[j])
  {
    t := t + [decode_char(s[i])];
    assert |t| == i + 1;
    assert t[i] == decode_char(s[i]);
    i := i + 1;
  }
  assert i == |s|;
}
</answer>

Explanation of added invariants and assertions:

1. For both `encode_shift` and `decode_shift`:
   - `invariant 0 <= i <= |s|`: Ensures that the loop counter `i` stays within bounds.
   - `invariant |t| == i`: Maintains the relationship between the length of `t` and the loop counter.
   - `invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> t[j] == encode_char(s[j])` (or `decode_char` for `decode_shift`): Ensures that all processed characters are correctly encoded/decoded.

2. Inside the loops:
   - `assert |t| == i + 1`: Verifies that the length of `t` increases by 1 after each iteration.
   - `assert t[i] == encode_char(s[i])` (or `decode_char` for `decode_shift`): Verifies that the newly added character is correctly encoded/decoded.

3. After the loops:
   - `assert i == |s|`: Confirms that the entire string has been processed.

These invariants and assertions help Dafny verify that the methods correctly implement the encoding and decoding operations as specified in the post-conditions.
