The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
method derivative(xs: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires |xs| > 0
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures |result| == |xs| - 1
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == xs[i+1] * (i+1)
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  result := [];
  var i := 1;
  while i < |xs|
  {
    result := result + [xs[i] * i];
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `derivative` takes a sequence of integers `xs` as input and returns a sequence of integers `result`.

2. The precondition requires that the input sequence `xs` is not empty.

3. The postconditions ensure that:
   a. The length of the result is one less than the input sequence.
   b. Each element in the result is the product of the corresponding element in the input (shifted by one) and its index plus one.

4. The implementation uses a while loop to build the result sequence.

Now, let's add invariants to the while loop:

1. We need to ensure that `i` stays within bounds:
   `invariant 1 <= i <= |xs|`

2. We need to ensure that the length of `result` is always `i-1`:
   `invariant |result| == i-1`

3. We need to ensure that the elements in `result` satisfy the condition in the postcondition:
   `invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |result| ==> result[j] == xs[j+1] * (j+1)`

These invariants should be sufficient to prove the postconditions.

Now, let's add an assertion after the loop body to help Dafny prove that the loop invariants are maintained:

`assert result[|result|-1] == xs[i] * i;`

This assertion helps Dafny understand that the newly added element satisfies the condition in the third invariant.

Here's the rewritten program with invariants and assertions:

<answer>
method derivative(xs: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
  requires |xs| > 0
  ensures |result| == |xs| - 1
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == xs[i+1] * (i+1)
{
  result := [];
  var i := 1;
  while i < |xs|
    invariant 1 <= i <= |xs|
    invariant |result| == i-1
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < |result| ==> result[j] == xs[j+1] * (j+1)
  {
    result := result + [xs[i] * i];
    assert result[|result|-1] == xs[i] * i;
    i := i + 1;
  }
}
