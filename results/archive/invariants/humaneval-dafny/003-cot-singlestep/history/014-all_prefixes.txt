The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method all_prefixes(s: string) returns (prefixes: seq<string>)
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures |prefixes| == |s|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |prefixes| ==> s[..i+1] == prefixes[i]
    // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    prefixes := [];
    for i := 0 to |s|
    {
        var current_prefix := s[..i+1];
        prefixes := prefixes + [current_prefix];
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and determine the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `all_prefixes` takes a string `s` as input and returns a sequence of strings `prefixes`.

2. The post-conditions ensure that:
   a. The length of `prefixes` is equal to the length of the input string `s`.
   b. For each index `i` in `prefixes`, the string at that index is equal to the prefix of `s` up to and including the character at index `i`.

3. The implementation uses a for-loop that iterates from 0 to |s| (exclusive), creating prefixes of increasing length and appending them to the `prefixes` sequence.

To prove that this implementation satisfies the post-conditions, we need to add loop invariants that maintain the following properties:

1. The length of `prefixes` is equal to the current loop index `i`.
2. All prefixes created so far are correct (i.e., they match the corresponding prefixes of `s`).

Let's add these invariants to the for-loop:

```dafny
invariant |prefixes| == i
invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> s[..j+1] == prefixes[j]
```

These invariants will help Dafny prove that the post-conditions hold after the loop terminates.

We don't need to add any additional assertions in this case, as the invariants are sufficient to prove the correctness of the implementation.

Here's the rewritten program with the added invariants:

<answer>
method all_prefixes(s: string) returns (prefixes: seq<string>)
    ensures |prefixes| == |s|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |prefixes| ==> s[..i+1] == prefixes[i]
{
    prefixes := [];
    for i := 0 to |s|
        invariant |prefixes| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> s[..j+1] == prefixes[j]
    {
        var current_prefix := s[..i+1];
        prefixes := prefixes + [current_prefix];
    }
}
</answer>

These invariants are sufficient to prove the correctness of the implementation:

1. The first invariant `|prefixes| == i` ensures that the length of `prefixes` grows with each iteration, and will be equal to `|s|` when the loop terminates.

2. The second invariant `forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> s[..j+1] == prefixes[j]` ensures that all prefixes created so far are correct. When the loop terminates, this will hold for all indices in `prefixes`, satisfying the second post-condition.

With these invariants in place, Dafny should be able to verify that the implementation satisfies the post-conditions.
