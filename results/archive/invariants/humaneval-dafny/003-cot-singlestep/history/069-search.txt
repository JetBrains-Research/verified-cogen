The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method freq(s: seq<int>, x: int) returns (count: int)
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures count == |(set i | 0 <= i < |s| && s[i] == x)|
    // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    count := 0;
    var i := 0;
    ghost var good := {};
    while (i < |s|)
    {
        if s[i] == x {
            count := count + 1;
            good := good + {i};
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `freq` takes a sequence of integers `s` and an integer `x` as input, and returns the count of occurrences of `x` in `s`.

2. The postcondition ensures that the returned `count` is equal to the size of the set of indices where `x` appears in `s`.

3. The implementation uses a loop to iterate through the sequence, incrementing `count` whenever `x` is found.

4. A ghost variable `good` is used to keep track of the indices where `x` is found. This is likely intended to help with the proof.

Now, let's add invariants to the loop:

1. We need an invariant to ensure that `i` stays within bounds:
   `invariant 0 <= i <= |s|`

2. We need an invariant to relate `count` to the size of `good`:
   `invariant count == |good|`

3. We need an invariant to ensure that `good` contains only valid indices where `x` is found:
   `invariant good == set j | 0 <= j < i && s[j] == x`

4. We need an invariant to relate the current state to the postcondition:
   `invariant count == |(set j | 0 <= j < i && s[j] == x)|`

Now, let's add some assertions to help Dafny prove the correctness:

1. After the if statement, we can assert that the new element has been added to `good`:
   `assert good == old(good) + {i};`

2. At the end of the loop, we can assert that `i` has reached the end of the sequence:
   `assert i == |s|;`

Here's the program with these additions:

<answer>
method freq(s: seq<int>, x: int) returns (count: int)
    ensures count == |(set i | 0 <= i < |s| && s[i] == x)|
{
    count := 0;
    var i := 0;
    ghost var good := {};
    while (i < |s|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
        invariant count == |good|
        invariant good == set j | 0 <= j < i && s[j] == x
        invariant count == |(set j | 0 <= j < i && s[j] == x)|
    {
        if s[i] == x {
            count := count + 1;
            good := good + {i};
            assert good == old(good) + {i};
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    assert i == |s|;
}
</answer>

These additions should help Dafny prove the correctness of the implementation with respect to the postcondition. The invariants ensure that the loop maintains the necessary properties throughout its execution, and the assertions provide additional hints to the prover about the state of the variables at key points in the code.
