The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method choose_num(x : int, y : int) returns (num : int)
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires 0 <= x && 0 <= y
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures num == -1 || (num >= x && num <= y)
  ensures num == -1 || num % 2 == 0
  ensures num == -1 || (forall i : int :: x <= i <= y && i % 2 == 0 ==> num >= i)
  ensures num == -1 <==> x >= y
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  num := -1;
  if x >= y {
    return;
  }
  if x % 2 == 0 {
    num := x;
  } else {
    num := x + 1;
  }
  var i := x + 2;
  while i <= y
  {
    if i % 2 == 0 {
      num := i;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program step by step:

1. The method `choose_num` takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns an integer `num`.

2. The preconditions require that both `x` and `y` are non-negative.

3. The postconditions ensure that:
   a) `num` is either -1 or between `x` and `y` inclusive.
   b) If `num` is not -1, it's even.
   c) If `num` is not -1, it's the largest even number between `x` and `y` inclusive.
   d) `num` is -1 if and only if `x >= y`.

4. The implementation first sets `num` to -1, then checks if `x >= y`. If so, it returns immediately, satisfying the last postcondition.

5. If `x < y`, it sets `num` to either `x` (if `x` is even) or `x + 1` (if `x` is odd).

6. Then it enters a loop that iterates from `x + 2` to `y`, updating `num` to the current `i` if `i` is even.

To prove this implementation correct, we need to add invariants to the loop and possibly some assertions. Let's add the invariants:

1. `x <= i <= y + 1`: This ensures that `i` stays within the correct range.
2. `num % 2 == 0`: This ensures that `num` is always even (except when it's -1).
3. `x <= num <= i - 1`: This ensures that `num` is always between `x` and the current `i - 1`.
4. `forall j :: x <= j < i && j % 2 == 0 ==> num >= j`: This ensures that `num` is the largest even number seen so far.

We also need to add an assertion before the loop to ensure that `num` is properly initialized:

`assert num % 2 == 0 && x <= num <= x + 1;`

This assertion helps Dafny understand that `num` is even and within the correct range before the loop starts.

Here's the program with these additions:

<answer>
method choose_num(x : int, y : int) returns (num : int)
  requires 0 <= x && 0 <= y
  ensures num == -1 || (num >= x && num <= y)
  ensures num == -1 || num % 2 == 0
  ensures num == -1 || (forall i : int :: x <= i <= y && i % 2 == 0 ==> num >= i)
  ensures num == -1 <==> x >= y
{
  num := -1;
  if x >= y {
    return;
  }
  if x % 2 == 0 {
    num := x;
  } else {
    num := x + 1;
  }
  assert num % 2 == 0 && x <= num <= x + 1;
  var i := x + 2;
  while i <= y
    invariant x <= i <= y + 1
    invariant num % 2 == 0
    invariant x <= num <= i - 1
    invariant forall j :: x <= j < i && j % 2 == 0 ==> num >= j
  {
    if i % 2 == 0 {
      num := i;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
}
</answer>

These invariants and the assertion should be sufficient for Dafny to verify that the implementation satisfies all postconditions.
