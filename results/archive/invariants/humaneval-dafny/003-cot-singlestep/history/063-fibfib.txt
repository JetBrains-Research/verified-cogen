The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
function fibfib(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 || n == 1 then 0
  else if n == 2 then 1
  else fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)
}
method ComputeFibFib(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures result == fibfib(n)
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  if n == 0 || n == 1 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 2 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b, c := 0, 0, 1;
  var i := 3;
  while i <= n
  {
    var temp := c + b + a;
    a := b;
    b := c;
    c := temp;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  return c;
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program step by step:

1. The `fibfib` function is a recursive implementation of a modified Fibonacci sequence where each number is the sum of the three preceding ones, starting with 0, 0, 1.

2. The `ComputeFibFib` method is an iterative implementation of the same sequence. It uses three variables (a, b, c) to keep track of the last three numbers in the sequence.

3. The post-condition ensures that the result of `ComputeFibFib` is equal to `fibfib(n)`.

To prove the correctness of `ComputeFibFib`, we need to add invariants to the while loop. The invariants should establish that at each iteration:

1. The loop variable `i` is within the correct range.
2. The variables a, b, and c correspond to the correct Fibonacci numbers.

Let's add these invariants:

1. `3 <= i <= n + 1`: This ensures that i starts at 3 and doesn't exceed n + 1.
2. `a == fibfib(i-3)`: a always holds the fibfib value for i-3.
3. `b == fibfib(i-2)`: b always holds the fibfib value for i-2.
4. `c == fibfib(i-1)`: c always holds the fibfib value for i-1.

We also need to add an assertion after the loop to connect the loop invariant to the post-condition. 

Here's the modified program with invariants and assertions:

<answer>
function fibfib(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 || n == 1 then 0
  else if n == 2 then 1
  else fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)
}

method ComputeFibFib(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
  ensures result == fibfib(n)
{
  if n == 0 || n == 1 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 2 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b, c := 0, 0, 1;
  var i := 3;
  while i <= n
    invariant 3 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant a == fibfib(i-3)
    invariant b == fibfib(i-2)
    invariant c == fibfib(i-1)
  {
    var temp := c + b + a;
    a := b;
    b := c;
    c := temp;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  assert i == n + 1;
  assert c == fibfib(n);
  return c;
}
</answer>

The added invariants ensure that at each iteration of the loop, the variables a, b, and c hold the correct Fibonacci values. The assertions after the loop connect the loop invariant to the post-condition, showing that when the loop terminates (i == n + 1), c holds the correct Fibonacci value for n.
