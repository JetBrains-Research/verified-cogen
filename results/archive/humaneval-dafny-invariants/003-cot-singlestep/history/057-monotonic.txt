The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method monotonic(xs: seq<int>) returns (result: bool)
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires |xs| > 0
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures result <==> (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |xs| ==> xs[i] < xs[j]) || (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |xs| ==> xs[i] > xs[j])
  // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    if |xs| == 1 {
        return true;
    }
    var increasing := true;
    var decreasing := true;
    var i := 1;
    while i < |xs|
    {
        if xs[i - 1] >= xs[i] {
            increasing := false;
        }
        if xs[i - 1] <= xs[i] {
            decreasing := false;
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    result := increasing || decreasing;
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `monotonic` takes a sequence of integers `xs` and returns a boolean `result`.

2. The precondition requires that the sequence is non-empty.

3. The postcondition ensures that the result is true if and only if the sequence is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

4. The implementation first handles the base case of a single-element sequence.

5. It then uses two boolean variables `increasing` and `decreasing` to track whether the sequence is strictly increasing or decreasing.

6. The main loop iterates through the sequence, updating these boolean variables.

Now, let's add invariants and assertions:

1. We need a loop invariant to ensure that `i` stays within bounds:
   `invariant 1 <= i <= |xs|`

2. We need invariants to capture the meaning of `increasing` and `decreasing`:
   `invariant increasing <==> forall k, l :: 0 <= k < l < i ==> xs[k] < xs[l]`
   `invariant decreasing <==> forall k, l :: 0 <= k < l < i ==> xs[k] > xs[l]`

3. We should add an assertion after the loop to connect the loop invariants to the postcondition:
   `assert i == |xs|;`
   `assert increasing <==> forall k, l :: 0 <= k < l < |xs| ==> xs[k] < xs[l];`
   `assert decreasing <==> forall k, l :: 0 <= k < l < |xs| ==> xs[k] > xs[l];`

Here's the program with these additions:

<answer>
method monotonic(xs: seq<int>) returns (result: bool)
  requires |xs| > 0
  ensures result <==> (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |xs| ==> xs[i] < xs[j]) || (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |xs| ==> xs[i] > xs[j])
{
    if |xs| == 1 {
        return true;
    }
    var increasing := true;
    var decreasing := true;
    var i := 1;
    while i < |xs|
        invariant 1 <= i <= |xs|
        invariant increasing <==> forall k, l :: 0 <= k < l < i ==> xs[k] < xs[l]
        invariant decreasing <==> forall k, l :: 0 <= k < l < i ==> xs[k] > xs[l]
    {
        if xs[i - 1] >= xs[i] {
            increasing := false;
        }
        if xs[i - 1] <= xs[i] {
            decreasing := false;
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    assert i == |xs|;
    assert increasing <==> forall k, l :: 0 <= k < l < |xs| ==> xs[k] < xs[l];
    assert decreasing <==> forall k, l :: 0 <= k < l < |xs| ==> xs[k] > xs[l];
    result := increasing || decreasing;
}
</answer>

These additions should help Dafny verify the correctness of the implementation with respect to the given specification.
