The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
predicate is_sorted(a: seq<int>) {
  forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |a| ==> a[i] <= a[j]
}
method move_one_ball(a: seq<int>) returns (can: bool)
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires |a| > 0
  requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |a| && 0 <= j < |a| && i != j ==> a[i] != a[j]
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures can <==> exists i :: 0 <= i < |a| && is_sorted(a[i..] + a[..i])
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  if |a| <= 1 {
    return true;
  }
  can := false;
  var i := 0;
  var min_index := 0;
  while i < |a|
  {
    if a[i] < a[min_index] {
      min_index := i;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  var new_a := a[min_index..] + a[..min_index];
  can := is_sorted(new_a);
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The `is_sorted` predicate checks if a sequence is sorted in ascending order.

2. The `move_one_ball` method takes a sequence of integers and returns a boolean indicating whether it's possible to sort the sequence by moving one element.

3. The preconditions ensure that:
   - The input sequence is not empty
   - All elements in the sequence are unique

4. The postcondition states that the method returns true if and only if there exists an index i such that moving the element at index i to the beginning (or end) of the sequence results in a sorted sequence.

5. The implementation finds the minimum element in the sequence and checks if moving it to the beginning results in a sorted sequence.

Now, let's add invariants and assertions:

1. For the while loop, we need invariants to ensure:
   - `i` stays within bounds
   - `min_index` always points to the minimum element found so far

2. We should add an assertion after the loop to confirm that `min_index` indeed points to the minimum element in the entire sequence.

3. We can add an assertion before the final assignment to `can` to make explicit the connection between the postcondition and the implementation.

Here's the program with added invariants and assertions:

<answer>
predicate is_sorted(a: seq<int>) {
  forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |a| ==> a[i] <= a[j]
}

method move_one_ball(a: seq<int>) returns (can: bool)
  requires |a| > 0
  requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |a| && 0 <= j < |a| && i != j ==> a[i] != a[j]
  ensures can <==> exists i :: 0 <= i < |a| && is_sorted(a[i..] + a[..i])
{
  if |a| <= 1 {
    return true;
  }
  can := false;
  var i := 0;
  var min_index := 0;
  while i < |a|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |a|
    invariant 0 <= min_index < |a|
    invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < i ==> a[min_index] <= a[k]
  {
    if a[i] < a[min_index] {
      min_index := i;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }

  assert forall k :: 0 <= k < |a| ==> a[min_index] <= a[k];

  var new_a := a[min_index..] + a[..min_index];
  
  assert new_a == a[min_index..] + a[..min_index];
  assert 0 <= min_index < |a|;
  
  can := is_sorted(new_a);
}
</answer>

Explanation of added invariants and assertions:

1. Loop invariants:
   - `0 <= i <= |a|`: Ensures `i` stays within bounds.
   - `0 <= min_index < |a|`: Ensures `min_index` always points to a valid index.
   - `forall k :: 0 <= k < i ==> a[min_index] <= a[k]`: Ensures `min_index` points to the minimum element found so far.

2. Assertion after the loop:
   - `assert forall k :: 0 <= k < |a| ==> a[min_index] <= a[k];`: Confirms that `min_index` points to the minimum element in the entire sequence.

3. Assertions before the final assignment:
   - `assert new_a == a[min_index..] + a[..min_index];`: Explicitly states the construction of `new_a`.
   - `assert 0 <= min_index < |a|;`: Ensures `min_index` is within bounds, which is necessary for the postcondition.

These additions help Dafny verify that the implementation correctly satisfies the postcondition.
