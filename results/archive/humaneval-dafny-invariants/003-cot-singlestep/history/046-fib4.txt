The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
function fib4_rec(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2 then 0
  else if n == 3 then 1
  else fib4_rec(n - 1) + fib4_rec(n - 2) + fib4_rec(n - 3) + fib4_rec(n - 4)
}
method fib4(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures result == fib4_rec(n)
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  if n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 3 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b, c, d := 0, 0, 0, 1;
  var i := 4;
  while i <= n
  {
    var temp := d + c + b + a;
    a := b;
    b := c;
    c := d;
    d := temp;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  return d;
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The function `fib4_rec` is a recursive implementation of a 4-step Fibonacci-like sequence. It's defined for natural numbers (nat).

2. The method `fib4` is an iterative implementation of the same sequence. It uses four variables (a, b, c, d) to keep track of the last four numbers in the sequence.

3. The post-condition ensures that the iterative method returns the same result as the recursive function.

To prove the correctness of the `fib4` method, we need to add invariants to the while loop. The invariants should establish that:

1. The loop variable `i` stays within the correct range.
2. The variables a, b, c, and d correspond to the correct Fibonacci-like numbers.

Let's add these invariants:

1. `0 <= i <= n + 1`: This ensures that i stays within the correct range.
2. `a == fib4_rec(i-4)`: a corresponds to the (i-4)th number in the sequence.
3. `b == fib4_rec(i-3)`: b corresponds to the (i-3)th number in the sequence.
4. `c == fib4_rec(i-2)`: c corresponds to the (i-2)th number in the sequence.
5. `d == fib4_rec(i-1)`: d corresponds to the (i-1)th number in the sequence.

We also need to add an assertion before the loop to establish that these invariants hold initially.

Here's the program with added invariants and assertions:

<answer>
function fib4_rec(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2 then 0
  else if n == 3 then 1
  else fib4_rec(n - 1) + fib4_rec(n - 2) + fib4_rec(n - 3) + fib4_rec(n - 4)
}
method fib4(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures result == fib4_rec(n)
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  if n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 3 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b, c, d := 0, 0, 0, 1;
  var i := 4;
  assert a == fib4_rec(0) && b == fib4_rec(1) && c == fib4_rec(2) && d == fib4_rec(3);
  while i <= n
    invariant 4 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant a == fib4_rec(i-4)
    invariant b == fib4_rec(i-3)
    invariant c == fib4_rec(i-2)
    invariant d == fib4_rec(i-1)
  {
    var temp := d + c + b + a;
    a := b;
    b := c;
    c := d;
    d := temp;
    i := i + 1;
    assert d == fib4_rec(i-1);
  }
  return d;
  // impl-end
}
</answer>

The added invariants ensure that at each iteration of the loop, the variables a, b, c, and d correspond to the correct Fibonacci-like numbers. The assertion before the loop establishes that these invariants hold initially. The assertion after each iteration of the loop helps Dafny verify that d always corresponds to the correct Fibonacci-like number.
