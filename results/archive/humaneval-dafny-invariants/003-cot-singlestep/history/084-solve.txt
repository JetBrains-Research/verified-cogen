The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
method solve(n: nat) returns (r: nat)
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures r == popcount(n)
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  var m := n;
  r := 0;
  while m > 0
  {
    r := r + m % 2;
    m := m / 2;
  }
  // impl-end
}
function popcount(n: nat): nat {
  if n == 0 then 0 else n % 2 + popcount(n / 2)
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program step by step:

1. The method `solve` takes a natural number `n` as input and returns a natural number `r`.

2. The post-condition ensures that the returned value `r` is equal to `popcount(n)`.

3. The `popcount` function is defined recursively. It returns the number of set bits (1's) in the binary representation of `n`.

4. The implementation uses a while loop to calculate the popcount. It repeatedly adds the least significant bit (m % 2) to `r` and then divides `m` by 2 (which is equivalent to a right shift in binary).

To prove the correctness of this implementation, we need to add invariants to the while loop. Let's consider what properties hold throughout the loop:

1. `r` always contains the popcount of the bits we've processed so far.
2. `m` contains the remaining unprocessed bits.
3. The sum of `r` and `popcount(m)` should always equal `popcount(n)`.

Based on these observations, we can add the following invariants:

```dafny
invariant r + popcount(m) == popcount(n)
invariant m >= 0
```

The first invariant captures the key property that allows us to prove correctness. The second invariant is needed because `m` is used in the loop condition and we need to ensure it stays non-negative.

We should also add an assertion after the loop to help Dafny prove that the post-condition holds:

```dafny
assert m == 0;
assert popcount(0) == 0;
```

These assertions help Dafny understand that when the loop terminates, `m` is 0, and the popcount of 0 is 0, which allows it to conclude that `r == popcount(n)`.

Here's the complete solution:

<answer>
method solve(n: nat) returns (r: nat)
  ensures r == popcount(n)
{
  var m := n;
  r := 0;
  while m > 0
    invariant r + popcount(m) == popcount(n)
    invariant m >= 0
  {
    r := r + m % 2;
    m := m / 2;
  }
  assert m == 0;
  assert popcount(0) == 0;
}

function popcount(n: nat): nat {
  if n == 0 then 0 else n % 2 + popcount(n / 2)
}
