The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method below_threshold(l : seq<int>, t : int) returns (b : bool)
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures b == (forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |l| ==> l[i] < t)
    // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    b := true;
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |l|)
    {
        if (l[i] >= t)
        {
            b := false;
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and determine the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `below_threshold` takes a sequence of integers `l` and an integer threshold `t` as input.

2. It returns a boolean `b` which should be true if and only if all elements in the sequence are below the threshold `t`.

3. The post-condition ensures that `b` is true if and only if all elements in `l` are less than `t`.

4. The implementation uses a loop to check each element of the sequence.

Now, let's consider the invariants we need:

1. Loop bounds: We need to ensure that `i` stays within the bounds of the sequence.
   Invariant: `0 <= i <= |l|`

2. Partial correctness: We need to ensure that at each step, `b` correctly represents whether all elements checked so far are below the threshold.
   Invariant: `b == (forall j : int :: 0 <= j < i ==> l[j] < t)`

3. Preservation of `b`: If `b` becomes false, it should stay false.
   This is implicitly handled by the code, but we can add an assertion to make it explicit.

Let's add these invariants and some helpful assertions:

<answer>
method below_threshold(l : seq<int>, t : int) returns (b : bool)
    ensures b == (forall i : int :: i >= 0 && i < |l| ==> l[i] < t)
{
    b := true;
    var i : int := 0;
    while (i < |l|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |l|
        invariant b == (forall j : int :: 0 <= j < i ==> l[j] < t)
    {
        if (l[i] >= t)
        {
            b := false;
            assert l[i] >= t;
            assert !(forall j : int :: 0 <= j < i+1 ==> l[j] < t);
        }
        
        assert b ==> (forall j : int :: 0 <= j < i+1 ==> l[j] < t);
        
        i := i + 1;
    }

    assert i == |l|;
    assert b == (forall j : int :: 0 <= j < |l| ==> l[j] < t);
}
</answer>

Explanation of added invariants and assertions:

1. The loop invariants ensure that `i` stays within bounds and that `b` correctly represents the state for all elements checked so far.

2. Inside the if-statement, we add assertions to help Dafny understand why `b` becomes false when we find an element greater than or equal to `t`.

3. After the if-statement, we assert that if `b` is still true, all elements up to and including the current one are below the threshold.

4. After the loop, we assert that `i` has reached the end of the sequence and that `b` now correctly represents the state for the entire sequence.

These invariants and assertions should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the implementation with respect to the given post-condition.
