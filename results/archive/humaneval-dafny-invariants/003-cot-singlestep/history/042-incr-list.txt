The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method incr_list(l: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures |result| == |l|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> result[i] == l[i] + 1
    // post-conditions-end
{
    // impl-start
    result := [];
    var i := 0;
    while i < |l|
    {
        result := result + [l[i] + 1];
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `incr_list` takes a sequence of integers `l` as input and returns a new sequence `result`.

2. The post-conditions ensure that:
   a. The length of the result is the same as the input.
   b. Each element in the result is one more than the corresponding element in the input.

3. The implementation uses a while loop to iterate through the input sequence, creating a new sequence with incremented values.

Now, let's add invariants to the while loop:

1. We need to ensure that `i` stays within bounds:
   `invariant 0 <= i <= |l|`

2. We need to ensure that the length of `result` is always equal to `i`:
   `invariant |result| == i`

3. We need to ensure that all elements in `result` so far are correctly incremented:
   `invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] == l[j] + 1`

These invariants will help Dafny prove that the post-conditions are met.

Now, let's add an assertion after the loop body to help Dafny understand that the new element is correctly added:
`assert result[i] == l[i] + 1;`

Here's the program with the added invariants and assertion:

<answer>
method incr_list(l: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    ensures |result| == |l|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |l| ==> result[i] == l[i] + 1
{
    result := [];
    var i := 0;
    while i < |l|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |l|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] == l[j] + 1
    {
        result := result + [l[i] + 1];
        assert result[i] == l[i] + 1;
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

These additions should be sufficient for Dafny to verify that the implementation meets the post-conditions. The invariants ensure that at each step of the loop, we maintain the necessary properties, and the assertion helps Dafny understand that each new element is correctly added to the result sequence.
