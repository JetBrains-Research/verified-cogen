The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

    } else {
      t := t + [swap_case(s[i])];

function rot2(c: char): char
  requires is_vowel(c)
{
    (c as int + 2) as char
}
predicate is_vowel(c: char) {
    (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u')
    || (c == 'A' || c == 'E' || c == 'I' || c == 'O' || c == 'U')
}


LLM: Let's analyze the program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The `encode` method takes a string `s` as input and returns a string `t`.

2. The precondition ensures that all characters in `s` are either lowercase or uppercase letters.

3. The postconditions ensure that:
   a. The length of `t` is equal to the length of `s`.
   b. For vowels, the corresponding character in `t` is the result of `rot2(swap_case(s[i]))`.
   c. For non-vowels, the corresponding character in `t` is the result of `swap_case(s[i])`.

4. The method uses a while loop to iterate through the characters of `s`.

To prove the correctness of this method, we need to add invariants to the while loop that maintain the postconditions throughout the iteration. We'll also add some assertions to help Dafny verify the code.

Here's the reasoning for the invariants:

1. We need to maintain that the length of `t` is equal to `i`, which is the number of characters processed so far.
2. We need to ensure that the characters in `t` up to index `i-1` satisfy the postconditions.
3. We need to maintain that `i` is within the bounds of `s`.

Now, let's add these invariants and some helpful assertions:

<answer>
method encode(s: string) returns (t: string)
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> 'a' <= s[i] <= 'z' || 'A' <= s[i] <= 'Z'

  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| && is_vowel(s[i]) ==> t[i] == rot2(swap_case(s[i]))
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| && !is_vowel(s[i]) ==> t[i] == swap_case(s[i])
{
  t := "";
  var i := 0;
  while i < |s|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
    invariant |t| == i
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i && is_vowel(s[j]) ==> t[j] == rot2(swap_case(s[j]))
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i && !is_vowel(s[j]) ==> t[j] == swap_case(s[j])
  {
    assert 'a' <= s[i] <= 'z' || 'A' <= s[i] <= 'Z';
    
    if is_vowel(s[i]) {
      t := t + [rot2(swap_case(s[i]))];
      assert t[i] == rot2(swap_case(s[i]));
    } else {
      t := t + [swap_case(s[i])];
      assert t[i] == swap_case(s[i]);
    }
    
    assert |t| == i + 1;
    assert forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> t[j] == old(t[j]);
    
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  assert i == |s|;
  assert |t| == |s|;
}

function swap_case(c: char): char
  requires 'a' <= c <= 'z' || 'A' <= c <= 'Z'
  ensures 'a' <= c <= 'z' ==> 'A' <= swap_case(c) <= 'Z'
  ensures 'A' <= c <= 'Z' ==> 'a' <= swap_case(c) <= 'z'
  ensures is_vowel(swap_case(c)) == is_vowel(c)
{
  if 'a' <= c <= 'z' then
    'A' + (c - 'a')
  else
    'a' + (c - 'A')
}

function rot2(c: char): char

    (c as int + 2) as char

predicate is_vowel(c: char) {
    (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u')
    || (c == 'A' || c == 'E' || c == 'I' || c == 'O' || c == 'U')
}
</answer>

Explanation of the added invariants and assertions:

1. `invariant 0 <= i <= |s|`: Ensures that `i` is always within the bounds of `s`.
2. `invariant |t| == i`: Maintains that the length of `t` is equal to the number of processed characters.
3. `invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i && is_vowel(s[j]) ==> t[j] == rot2(swap_case(s[j]))`: Ensures that all vowels processed so far satisfy the postcondition.
4. `invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i && !is_vowel(s[j]) ==> t[j] == swap_case(s[j])`: Ensures that all non-vowels processed so far satisfy the postcondition.
5. `assert 'a' <= s[i] <= 'z' || 'A' <= s[i] <= 'Z'`: Reminds Dafny of the precondition for the current character.
6. `assert t[i] == rot2(swap_case(s[i]))` and `assert t[i] == swap_case(s[i])`: Verify that the newly added character satisfies the postcondition.
7. `assert |t| == i + 1`: Verifies that the length of `t` has increased by 1.
8. `assert forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> t[j] == old(t[j])`: Ensures that previously processed characters haven't changed.
9. `assert i == |s|` and `assert |t| == |s|`: Verify the final postcondition about the lengths of `s` and `t`.

These invariants and assertions help Dafny verify that the `encode` method satisfies its postconditions.
