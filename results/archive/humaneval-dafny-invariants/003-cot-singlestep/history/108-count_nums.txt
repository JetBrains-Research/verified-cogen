The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The lemma `sum_prop` states that given that length of a sequence is greater than 0, the sum of the sequence is equal to the sum of first `|s| - 1` elements plus the last element.

3. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method count_nums(s: seq<int>) returns (cnt: nat)
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures cnt == |set i | 0 <= i < |s| && digits_sum(s[i]) > 0|
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  ghost var found := {};
  cnt := 0;
  var i := 0;
  while i < |s|
  {
    if digits_sum(s[i]) > 0 {
      found := found + {i};
      cnt := cnt + 1;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}
function digits_sum(x: int): int
  decreases abs(x)
{
  if abs(x) < 10 then x else x % 10 + digits_sum(x / 10)
}
function abs(x: int): int
  ensures abs(x) >= 0
  ensures abs(x) == x || abs(x) == -x
{
  if x >= 0 then x else -x
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary invariants and assertions:

1. The method `count_nums` takes a sequence of integers and returns a natural number.
2. The postcondition ensures that the returned count (`cnt`) is equal to the number of elements in the sequence whose sum of digits is greater than 0.
3. The method uses a ghost variable `found` to keep track of the indices of elements that satisfy the condition.
4. It iterates through the sequence, incrementing the count when an element's sum of digits is greater than 0.

To prove the correctness of this method, we need to add invariants that maintain the relationship between `cnt`, `found`, and the loop variable `i`. We'll also need to ensure that `i` stays within bounds.

Here are the invariants we should add:

1. `0 <= i <= |s|`: This ensures that `i` stays within the bounds of the sequence.
2. `cnt == |found|`: This maintains the relationship between `cnt` and the ghost set `found`.
3. `found == set j | 0 <= j < i && digits_sum(s[j]) > 0`: This ensures that `found` contains exactly the indices of elements we've processed so far that satisfy the condition.

We don't need to add any additional assertions in this case, as the invariants should be sufficient to prove the postcondition.

Here's the rewritten program with the added invariants:

<answer>
method count_nums(s: seq<int>) returns (cnt: nat)
  ensures cnt == |set i | 0 <= i < |s| && digits_sum(s[i]) > 0|
{
  ghost var found := {};
  cnt := 0;
  var i := 0;
  while i < |s|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
    invariant cnt == |found|
    invariant found == set j | 0 <= j < i && digits_sum(s[j]) > 0
  {
    if digits_sum(s[i]) > 0 {
      found := found + {i};
      cnt := cnt + 1;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
}

function digits_sum(x: int): int
  decreases abs(x)
{
  if abs(x) < 10 then x else x % 10 + digits_sum(x / 10)
}

function abs(x: int): int
  ensures abs(x) >= 0
  ensures abs(x) == x || abs(x) == -x
{
  if x >= 0 then x else -x
}
</answer>

These invariants should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the `count_nums` method. The invariants maintain the necessary properties throughout the loop execution, and when the loop terminates (i.e., when `i == |s|`), the postcondition follows directly from the loop invariants.
