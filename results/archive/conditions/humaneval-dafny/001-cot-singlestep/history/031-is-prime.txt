The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`. It's postcondition would be that the result `s` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence. (`s == sum(numbers)`)

3. Finally, we have the `sum_prop` lemma, which is a helper function. We know that `sum(s)` is equal to the first element of the sequence, plus the sum of the rest of the elements. However, in the loop we are adding the last element of the sequence to the sum of the rest of the elements. So we need to prove that `sum(s)` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence without the last element (`sum(s[..|s| - 1])`) plus the last element (`s[ |s| - 1 ]`). The precondition for this lemma would be that `|s| > 0`, as for an empty sequence, we can't take the last element. Postcondition would be that `sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
method is_prime(k: int) returns (result: bool)
{
  // impl-start
  var i := 2;
  result := true;
  while i < k
  {
    if k % i == 0 {
      result := false;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and add the necessary preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and assertions to make it verify.

1. Precondition:
   We need to ensure that the input `k` is a positive integer greater than 1. Prime numbers are defined only for integers greater than 1.

2. Postcondition:
   The method should return `true` if `k` is prime, and `false` otherwise. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

3. Loop Invariant:
   We need to maintain that:
   a) `i` is always between 2 and `k`.
   b) `result` is true if and only if `k` is not divisible by any number from 2 to `i-1`.

4. Assertions:
   We can add assertions to help Dafny understand the logic better, especially regarding the primality check.

Now, let's implement these ideas:

<answer>
method is_prime(k: int) returns (result: bool)
  requires k > 1
  ensures result <==> forall x :: 2 <= x < k ==> k % x != 0
{
  // impl-start
  var i := 2;
  result := true;
  while i < k
    invariant 2 <= i <= k
    invariant result <==> forall x :: 2 <= x < i ==> k % x != 0
  {
    if k % i == 0 {
      result := false;
      assert k % i == 0;
      assert !(forall x :: 2 <= x < k ==> k % x != 0);
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
  assert i == k;
}
</answer>

Explanation of the changes:

1. Precondition `requires k > 1`:
   This ensures that the input is valid for primality testing.

2. Postcondition `ensures result <==> forall x :: 2 <= x < k ==> k % x != 0`:
   This states that the result is true if and only if k is not divisible by any number from 2 to k-1, which is the definition of a prime number.

3. Loop Invariants:
   - `invariant 2 <= i <= k`: This maintains that i is always in the correct range.
   - `invariant result <==> forall x :: 2 <= x < i ==> k % x != 0`: This maintains that result is true if and only if k is not divisible by any number from 2 to i-1.

4. Assertion in the if-statement:
   - `assert k % i == 0`: This helps Dafny understand why result is set to false.
   - `assert !(forall x :: 2 <= x < k ==> k % x != 0)`: This helps Dafny connect the local condition to the global postcondition.

5. Final assertion `assert i == k`:
   This helps Dafny understand that the loop has completed and i has reached k.

These additions should allow Dafny to verify the correctness of the is_prime method.
