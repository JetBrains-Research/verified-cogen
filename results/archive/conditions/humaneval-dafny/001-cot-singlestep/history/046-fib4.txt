The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`. It's postcondition would be that the result `s` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence. (`s == sum(numbers)`)

3. Finally, we have the `sum_prop` lemma, which is a helper function. We know that `sum(s)` is equal to the first element of the sequence, plus the sum of the rest of the elements. However, in the loop we are adding the last element of the sequence to the sum of the rest of the elements. So we need to prove that `sum(s)` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence without the last element (`sum(s[..|s| - 1])`) plus the last element (`s[ |s| - 1 ]`). The precondition for this lemma would be that `|s| > 0`, as for an empty sequence, we can't take the last element. Postcondition would be that `sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
function fib4_rec(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2 then 0
  else if n == 3 then 1
  else fib4_rec(n - 1) + fib4_rec(n - 2) + fib4_rec(n - 3) + fib4_rec(n - 4)
}
method fib4(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
{
  // impl-start
  if n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 3 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b, c, d := 0, 0, 0, 1;
  var i := 4;
  while i <= n
  {
    var temp := d + c + b + a;
    a := b;
    b := c;
    c := d;
    d := temp;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  return d;
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and add the necessary annotations to make it verify:

1. The `fib4_rec` function is a recursive implementation of a 4-step Fibonacci sequence. It's already annotated with `decreases n` to ensure termination.

2. The `fib4` method is an iterative implementation of the same sequence. We need to prove that it produces the same results as the recursive function.

To make this program verify, we need to:

1. Add a postcondition to `fib4` method to ensure it returns the same result as `fib4_rec`.
2. Add loop invariants to prove that the iterative implementation maintains the correct state at each iteration.
3. Add assertions to help Dafny understand the relationship between the variables and the recursive function.

Here's the reasoning for the annotations:

1. Postcondition: `ensures result == fib4_rec(n)` - This ensures that the method returns the same result as the recursive function.

2. Loop invariants:
   - `invariant i <= n + 1` - Ensures the loop counter stays within bounds.
   - `invariant a == fib4_rec(i-4)` - Relates `a` to the recursive function.
   - `invariant b == fib4_rec(i-3)` - Relates `b` to the recursive function.
   - `invariant c == fib4_rec(i-2)` - Relates `c` to the recursive function.
   - `invariant d == fib4_rec(i-1)` - Relates `d` to the recursive function.

3. Assertions:
   - Before the loop, we assert the initial values of a, b, c, and d correspond to the recursive function.
   - After the loop, we assert that d equals the recursive function call for n.

Now, let's add these annotations to the program:

<answer>
function fib4_rec(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2 then 0
  else if n == 3 then 1
  else fib4_rec(n - 1) + fib4_rec(n - 2) + fib4_rec(n - 3) + fib4_rec(n - 4)
}

method fib4(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
  ensures result == fib4_rec(n)
{
  // impl-start
  if n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 3 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b, c, d := 0, 0, 0, 1;
  var i := 4;
  
  assert a == fib4_rec(0);
  assert b == fib4_rec(1);
  assert c == fib4_rec(2);
  assert d == fib4_rec(3);
  
  while i <= n
    invariant i <= n + 1
    invariant a == fib4_rec(i-4)
    invariant b == fib4_rec(i-3)
    invariant c == fib4_rec(i-2)
    invariant d == fib4_rec(i-1)
  {
    var temp := d + c + b + a;
    a := b;
    b := c;
    c := d;
    d := temp;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  
  assert d == fib4_rec(n);
  return d;
  // impl-end
}
</answer>

These annotations should be sufficient for Dafny to verify that the iterative implementation `fib4` produces the same results as the recursive implementation `fib4_rec`.
