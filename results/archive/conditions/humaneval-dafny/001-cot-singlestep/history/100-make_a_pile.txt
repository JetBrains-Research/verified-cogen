The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`. It's postcondition would be that the result `s` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence. (`s == sum(numbers)`)

3. Finally, we have the `sum_prop` lemma, which is a helper function. We know that `sum(s)` is equal to the first element of the sequence, plus the sum of the rest of the elements. However, in the loop we are adding the last element of the sequence to the sum of the rest of the elements. So we need to prove that `sum(s)` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence without the last element (`sum(s[..|s| - 1])`) plus the last element (`s[ |s| - 1 ]`). The precondition for this lemma would be that `|s| > 0`, as for an empty sequence, we can't take the last element. Postcondition would be that `sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
method make_a_pile(n: int) returns (pile: seq<int>)
{
    // impl-start
    pile := [];
    if n == 0 {
        return;
    }
    pile := [n];
    var i := 1;
    while i < n
    {
        pile := pile + [pile[i - 1] + 2];
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and determine the appropriate preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and assertions to make it verify.

1. Precondition:
   The method should work for non-negative integers. We don't want to allow negative values for n, so we'll add a precondition:
   requires n >= 0

2. Postconditions:
   We need to specify what the output sequence 'pile' should look like:
   - Its length should be equal to n:
     ensures |pile| == n
   - If n > 0, the first element should be n:
     ensures n > 0 ==> pile[0] == n
   - Each subsequent element should be 2 more than the previous one:
     ensures forall i :: 0 < i < |pile| ==> pile[i] == pile[i-1] + 2

3. Loop invariants:
   For the while loop, we need to specify:
   - The range of i:
     invariant 1 <= i <= n
   - The length of pile at each iteration:
     invariant |pile| == i
   - The content of pile up to the current index:
     invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> pile[j] == n + 2*j

4. Assertions:
   We don't need any additional assertions as the invariants and postconditions should be sufficient for verification.

Now, let's add these specifications to the program:

<answer>
method make_a_pile(n: int) returns (pile: seq<int>)
    requires n >= 0
    ensures |pile| == n
    ensures n > 0 ==> pile[0] == n
    ensures forall i :: 0 < i < |pile| ==> pile[i] == pile[i-1] + 2
{
    pile := [];
    if n == 0 {
        return;
    }
    pile := [n];
    var i := 1;
    while i < n
        invariant 1 <= i <= n
        invariant |pile| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> pile[j] == n + 2*j
    {
        pile := pile + [pile[i - 1] + 2];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

This modified version of the program should now verify in Dafny. The preconditions ensure that the input is valid, the postconditions specify the expected output, and the loop invariants help Dafny understand the state of the program at each iteration of the loop. These additions allow Dafny to prove that the implementation correctly produces a sequence that satisfies the specified properties.
