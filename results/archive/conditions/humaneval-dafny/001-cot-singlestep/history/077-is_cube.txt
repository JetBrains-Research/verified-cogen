The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`. It's postcondition would be that the result `s` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence. (`s == sum(numbers)`)

3. Finally, we have the `sum_prop` lemma, which is a helper function. We know that `sum(s)` is equal to the first element of the sequence, plus the sum of the rest of the elements. However, in the loop we are adding the last element of the sequence to the sum of the rest of the elements. So we need to prove that `sum(s)` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence without the last element (`sum(s[..|s| - 1])`) plus the last element (`s[ |s| - 1 ]`). The precondition for this lemma would be that `|s| > 0`, as for an empty sequence, we can't take the last element. Postcondition would be that `sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
method cube_root(N: nat) returns (r: nat)
{
  // impl-start
  r := 0;
  while cube(r + 1) <= N
  {
    r := r + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}
method is_cube(n: nat) returns (r: bool)
{
    // impl-start
    var root := cube_root(n);
    if cube(root) == n {
        r := true;
    } else {
        cube_of_larger_is_larger();
        r := false;
    }
    // impl-end
}
function cube(n: int): int { n * n * n }
lemma cube_of_larger_is_larger()
    ensures forall smaller : int, larger : int :: smaller <= larger ==> cube(smaller) <= cube(larger)
{}


LLM: Let's analyze the program and add the necessary specifications:

1. cube_root method:
   This method takes a natural number N and returns its integer cube root r. The cube root is the largest natural number r such that r^3 <= N.

   Precondition: None needed, as N is already specified as a nat (non-negative integer).
   
   Postcondition: 
   - r^3 <= N (the result is not larger than the cube root)
   - (r+1)^3 > N (the next integer would be too large)

   Loop invariant:
   - r^3 <= N (maintains the lower bound property throughout the loop)

2. is_cube method:
   This method checks if a given natural number n is a perfect cube.

   Precondition: None needed, as n is already specified as a nat.

   Postcondition: 
   - r <==> exists x :: n == x * x * x (r is true if and only if n is a perfect cube)

3. cube function:
   This is already correctly defined.

4. cube_of_larger_is_larger lemma:
   This lemma is correctly specified but lacks a body. We'll add a trivial body to satisfy Dafny.

Now, let's implement these specifications:

<answer>
method cube_root(N: nat) returns (r: nat)
    ensures cube(r) <= N
    ensures cube(r + 1) > N
{
    r := 0;
    while cube(r + 1) <= N
        invariant cube(r) <= N
    {
        r := r + 1;
    }
}

method is_cube(n: nat) returns (r: bool)
    ensures r <==> exists x :: n == cube(x)
{
    var root := cube_root(n);
    if cube(root) == n {
        r := true;
    } else {
        cube_of_larger_is_larger();
        assert cube(root) < n;  // From the postcondition of cube_root
        assert cube(root + 1) > n;  // From the postcondition of cube_root
        assert forall x :: x <= root ==> cube(x) <= n;  // From cube_of_larger_is_larger
        assert forall x :: x > root ==> cube(x) > n;  // From cube_of_larger_is_larger
        r := false;
    }
}

function cube(n: int): int { n * n * n }

lemma cube_of_larger_is_larger()
    ensures forall smaller : int, larger : int :: smaller <= larger ==> cube(smaller) <= cube(larger)
{
    // Trivial body to satisfy Dafny
}
</answer>

Explanation of the changes:

1. For cube_root:
   - Added postconditions to ensure the result is the largest integer whose cube is not greater than N.
   - Added a loop invariant to maintain that r^3 <= N throughout the loop.

2. For is_cube:
   - Added a postcondition to specify that r is true if and only if n is a perfect cube.
   - Added assertions in the else branch to help Dafny understand why n is not a perfect cube when cube(root) != n.

3. For cube_of_larger_is_larger:
   - Added an empty body to satisfy Dafny's requirement for lemma implementation.

These specifications should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the program.
