The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`. It's postcondition would be that the result `s` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence. (`s == sum(numbers)`)

3. Finally, we have the `sum_prop` lemma, which is a helper function. We know that `sum(s)` is equal to the first element of the sequence, plus the sum of the rest of the elements. However, in the loop we are adding the last element of the sequence to the sum of the rest of the elements. So we need to prove that `sum(s)` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence without the last element (`sum(s[..|s| - 1])`) plus the last element (`s[ |s| - 1 ]`). The precondition for this lemma would be that `|s| > 0`, as for an empty sequence, we can't take the last element. Postcondition would be that `sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
function fibfib(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 || n == 1 then 0
  else if n == 2 then 1
  else fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)
}
method ComputeFibFib(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
{
  // impl-start
  if n == 0 || n == 1 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 2 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b, c := 0, 0, 1;
  var i := 3;
  while i <= n
  {
    var temp := c + b + a;
    a := b;
    b := c;
    c := temp;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  return c;
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and assertions to make it verify.

1. The `fibfib` function:
   This is a recursive function that calculates the "fibfib" sequence. It's already defined with a `decreases n` clause, which is good for proving termination. We don't need to modify this function.

2. The `ComputeFibFib` method:
   This method implements an iterative approach to calculate the same "fibfib" sequence. We need to prove that this method correctly implements the `fibfib` function.

Here's the reasoning for the additions we'll make:

1. Postcondition: We need to ensure that the result of `ComputeFibFib` is equal to `fibfib(n)` for any input `n`.

2. Loop invariants:
   a. We need to maintain that `i` is always between 3 and n+1 (inclusive).
   b. We need to show that at each iteration, `c` equals `fibfib(i-1)`, `b` equals `fibfib(i-2)`, and `a` equals `fibfib(i-3)`.

3. Assertions:
   We'll add assertions after the loop to show that the final values satisfy the fibfib sequence definition.

Now, let's add these to the program:

<answer>
function fibfib(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 || n == 1 then 0
  else if n == 2 then 1
  else fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)
}

method ComputeFibFib(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
  ensures result == fibfib(n)
{
  // impl-start
  if n == 0 || n == 1 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 2 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b, c := 0, 0, 1;
  var i := 3;
  while i <= n
    invariant 3 <= i <= n + 1
    invariant a == fibfib(i-3)
    invariant b == fibfib(i-2)
    invariant c == fibfib(i-1)
  {
    var temp := c + b + a;
    a := b;
    b := c;
    c := temp;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  assert i == n + 1;
  assert a == fibfib(n-2);
  assert b == fibfib(n-1);
  assert c == fibfib(n);
  return c;
  // impl-end
}
</answer>

This modified version should now verify in Dafny. The postcondition ensures that the method returns the correct result. The loop invariants maintain the relationship between the variables and the fibfib sequence at each iteration. The assertions after the loop help Dafny understand that the final state satisfies the fibfib sequence definition.
