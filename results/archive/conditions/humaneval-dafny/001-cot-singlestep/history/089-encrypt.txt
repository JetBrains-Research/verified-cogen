The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`. It's postcondition would be that the result `s` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence. (`s == sum(numbers)`)

3. Finally, we have the `sum_prop` lemma, which is a helper function. We know that `sum(s)` is equal to the first element of the sequence, plus the sum of the rest of the elements. However, in the loop we are adding the last element of the sequence to the sum of the rest of the elements. So we need to prove that `sum(s)` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence without the last element (`sum(s[..|s| - 1])`) plus the last element (`s[ |s| - 1 ]`). The precondition for this lemma would be that `|s| > 0`, as for an empty sequence, we can't take the last element. Postcondition would be that `sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
function rot_sym(c: char): char
{
  // impl-start
  var alph := c as int - 'a' as int;
  ((alph + 2 * 2) % 26 + 'a' as int) as char
  // impl-end
}
method encrypt(s: string) returns (r: string)
{
  // impl-start
  r := "";
  var i := 0;
  while i < |s|
  {
    r := r + [rot_sym(s[i])];
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}
method Main() {
    var s := "asdfghjkl";
    var r := encrypt(s);
    assert r == "ewhjklnop";
}


LLM: Let's analyze the program and add the necessary annotations to make it verify:

1. Function `rot_sym`:
   This function takes a character and applies a rotation cipher to it. It shifts the character by 4 positions in the alphabet (wrapping around if necessary). We need to ensure that the input is a lowercase letter and that the output is also a lowercase letter.

2. Method `encrypt`:
   This method takes a string and applies the `rot_sym` function to each character. We need to ensure that the length of the output string is the same as the input string, and that each character in the output is the result of applying `rot_sym` to the corresponding character in the input.

3. Method `Main`:
   This method tests the `encrypt` function with a specific input. We need to ensure that the assertion holds.

Now, let's add the necessary annotations:

<answer>
function rot_sym(c: char): char
  requires 'a' <= c <= 'z'
  ensures 'a' <= rot_sym(c) <= 'z'
  ensures rot_sym(c) as int - 'a' as int == (c as int - 'a' as int + 4) % 26
{
  // impl-start
  var alph := c as int - 'a' as int;
  ((alph + 2 * 2) % 26 + 'a' as int) as char
  // impl-end
}

method encrypt(s: string) returns (r: string)
  requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> 'a' <= s[i] <= 'z'
  ensures |r| == |s|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> r[i] == rot_sym(s[i])
{
  // impl-start
  r := "";
  var i := 0;
  while i < |s|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
    invariant |r| == i
    invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> r[j] == rot_sym(s[j])
  {
    r := r + [rot_sym(s[i])];
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}

method Main() {
    var s := "asdfghjkl";
    var r := encrypt(s);
    assert r == "ewhjklnop";
}
</answer>

Explanation of the added annotations:

1. For `rot_sym`:
   - Precondition: The input character must be a lowercase letter.
   - Postconditions: 
     - The output character is also a lowercase letter.
     - The output character is shifted by 4 positions (mod 26) from the input character.

2. For `encrypt`:
   - Precondition: All characters in the input string must be lowercase letters.
   - Postconditions:
     - The length of the output string is the same as the input string.
     - Each character in the output is the result of applying `rot_sym` to the corresponding character in the input.
   - Loop invariants:
     - The loop counter `i` is between 0 and the length of the input string.
     - The length of the output string `r` is equal to the current value of `i`.
     - All characters processed so far in the output string are the result of applying `rot_sym` to the corresponding characters in the input string.

3. For `Main`:
   - No additional annotations are needed, as the assertion is already present and will be verified based on the postconditions of `encrypt`.

These annotations should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the program.
