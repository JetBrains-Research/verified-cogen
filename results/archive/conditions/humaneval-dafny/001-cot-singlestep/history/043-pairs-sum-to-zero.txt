The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`. It's postcondition would be that the result `s` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence. (`s == sum(numbers)`)

3. Finally, we have the `sum_prop` lemma, which is a helper function. We know that `sum(s)` is equal to the first element of the sequence, plus the sum of the rest of the elements. However, in the loop we are adding the last element of the sequence to the sum of the rest of the elements. So we need to prove that `sum(s)` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence without the last element (`sum(s[..|s| - 1])`) plus the last element (`s[ |s| - 1 ]`). The precondition for this lemma would be that `|s| > 0`, as for an empty sequence, we can't take the last element. Postcondition would be that `sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
method pairs_sum_to_zero(l : seq<int>) returns (result : bool)
{
    // impl-start
    result := false;
    var i : int := 0;
    while i < |l|
    {
        var j : int := 0;
        while j < |l|
        {
            if i != j && l[i] + l[j] == 0 {
                result := true;
            }
            j := j + 1;
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze this program and add the necessary annotations to make it verify:

1. The method `pairs_sum_to_zero` takes a sequence of integers `l` as input and returns a boolean `result`.

2. The purpose of this method is to check if there exist two different elements in the sequence that sum to zero.

3. The method uses nested loops to compare each element with every other element in the sequence.

Now, let's add the necessary annotations:

1. Postcondition: The postcondition should express that `result` is true if and only if there exist two different indices i and j such that l[i] + l[j] = 0.

2. Loop invariants: 
   - For the outer loop, we need to maintain that 0 <= i <= |l|
   - For the inner loop, we need to maintain that 0 <= j <= |l|
   - We also need to maintain that `result` is true if we've found a pair that sums to zero in the portion of the sequence we've already checked.

3. Assertions: We don't need any additional assertions as the logic is straightforward.

Here's the program with the added annotations:

<answer>
method pairs_sum_to_zero(l : seq<int>) returns (result : bool)
    ensures result <==> exists i, j :: 0 <= i < |l| && 0 <= j < |l| && i != j && l[i] + l[j] == 0
{
    // impl-start
    result := false;
    var i : int := 0;
    while i < |l|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |l|
        invariant result <==> exists m, n :: 0 <= m < i && 0 <= n < |l| && m != n && l[m] + l[n] == 0
    {
        var j : int := 0;
        while j < |l|
            invariant 0 <= j <= |l|
            invariant result <==> (exists m, n :: 0 <= m < i && 0 <= n < |l| && m != n && l[m] + l[n] == 0) ||
                                  (exists n :: 0 <= n < j && i != n && l[i] + l[n] == 0)
        {
            if i != j && l[i] + l[j] == 0 {
                result := true;
            }
            j := j + 1;
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // impl-end
}
</answer>

Explanation of the annotations:

1. The postcondition `ensures result <==> exists i, j :: 0 <= i < |l| && 0 <= j < |l| && i != j && l[i] + l[j] == 0` states that the result is true if and only if there exist two different indices i and j in the valid range such that l[i] + l[j] = 0.

2. The outer loop invariant `invariant 0 <= i <= |l|` maintains that i is always within the valid range.

3. The outer loop invariant `invariant result <==> exists m, n :: 0 <= m < i && 0 <= n < |l| && m != n && l[m] + l[n] == 0` maintains that result is true if and only if we've found a pair that sums to zero in the portion of the sequence we've already checked (up to index i-1).

4. The inner loop invariant `invariant 0 <= j <= |l|` maintains that j is always within the valid range.

5. The inner loop invariant `invariant result <==> (exists m, n :: 0 <= m < i && 0 <= n < |l| && m != n && l[m] + l[n] == 0) || (exists n :: 0 <= n < j && i != n && l[i] + l[n] == 0)` maintains that result is true if either we've found a pair that sums to zero in the previously checked elements, or we've found a pair in the current iteration of the outer loop (up to index j-1).

These annotations should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the implementation.
