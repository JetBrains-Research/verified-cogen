The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`. It's postcondition would be that the result `s` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence. (`s == sum(numbers)`)

3. Finally, we have the `sum_prop` lemma, which is a helper function. We know that `sum(s)` is equal to the first element of the sequence, plus the sum of the rest of the elements. However, in the loop we are adding the last element of the sequence to the sum of the rest of the elements. So we need to prove that `sum(s)` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence without the last element (`sum(s[..|s| - 1])`) plus the last element (`s[ |s| - 1 ]`). The precondition for this lemma would be that `|s| > 0`, as for an empty sequence, we can't take the last element. Postcondition would be that `sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
</answer>

The program:
function fib(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 0
  else if n == 1 then 1
  else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}
method ComputeFib(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
{
  // impl-start
  if n == 0 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 1 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b := 0, 1;
  var i := 2;
  while i <= n
  {
    var temp := a + b;
    a := b;
    b := temp;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  return b;
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the program and add the necessary annotations to make it verify:

1. The `fib` function is already defined recursively and correctly represents the Fibonacci sequence. It has a `decreases n` clause to ensure termination.

2. The `ComputeFib` method is an iterative implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. We need to prove that it produces the same result as the recursive `fib` function.

3. We'll need to add a postcondition to `ComputeFib` to ensure it returns the correct Fibonacci number.

4. For the while loop, we'll need invariants to maintain the relationship between `a`, `b`, and the Fibonacci sequence.

Here's the reasoning for the invariants and assertions we'll add:

1. We need to ensure that `a` and `b` always represent two consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Specifically, `a` should be `fib(i-2)` and `b` should be `fib(i-1)`.

2. We need to make sure that `i` stays within the correct range: `2 <= i <= n+1`. This ensures that we don't go beyond the desired Fibonacci number.

3. After the loop, `b` should contain the nth Fibonacci number, which is what we want to return.

4. We'll use assertions to help Dafny understand the relationship between consecutive steps in the loop.

Now, let's add these annotations to the program:

<answer>
function fib(n: nat): nat
  decreases n
{
  if n == 0 then 0
  else if n == 1 then 1
  else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}

method ComputeFib(n: nat) returns (result: nat)
  ensures result == fib(n)
{
  // impl-start
  if n == 0 {
    return 0;
  }
  if n == 1 {
    return 1;
  }
  var a, b := 0, 1;
  var i := 2;
  while i <= n
    invariant 2 <= i <= n+1
    invariant a == fib(i-2)
    invariant b == fib(i-1)
  {
    assert a == fib(i-2) && b == fib(i-1);
    var temp := a + b;
    a := b;
    b := temp;
    assert b == fib(i);
    i := i + 1;
    assert a == fib(i-2) && b == fib(i-1);
  }
  assert i == n+1;
  assert b == fib(n);
  return b;
  // impl-end
}
</answer>

These annotations should be sufficient for Dafny to verify the correctness of the `ComputeFib` method. The invariants ensure that the loop maintains the correct relationship between `a`, `b`, and the Fibonacci sequence. The assertions help Dafny understand the step-by-step logic of the loop. The postcondition ensures that the method returns the correct Fibonacci number.
