The program:

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```


LLM: Let's go over the provided program step by step.
First, we'll identify what each function does and what its input and output are.

1. The function `sum` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. Looking at it's body, we see that it takes the first element of the sequence, adds it to the sum of the rest of the elements, and returns the result.

2. The method `sum_loop` takes a `seq<int>` as input and returns an `int` as output. It has an accumulator variable `s` that starts at 0. It then loops through the sequence, adding each element to the accumulator. As we see, it uses a `while` loop, so one of the invariants dafny requires is that `0 <= i <= |s|`. It's postcondition would be that the result `s` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence. (`s == sum(numbers)`)

3. Finally, we have the `sum_prop` lemma, which is a helper function. We know that `sum(s)` is equal to the first element of the sequence, plus the sum of the rest of the elements. However, in the loop we are adding the last element of the sequence to the sum of the rest of the elements. So we need to prove that `sum(s)` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sequence without the last element (`sum(s[..|s| - 1])`) plus the last element (`s[ |s| - 1 ]`). The precondition for this lemma would be that `|s| > 0`, as for an empty sequence, we can't take the last element. Postcondition would be that `sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]`.

Now, let's try to prove the `sum_loop` method. We'll start by adding the `0 <= i <= |s|` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
```

Next, we need to use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`. To do this, we'll need to prove that adding `numbers[i]` to `sum(numbers[0..i])` results in `sum(numbers[0..i + 1])`. That's exactly what `sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1])` does. For dafny to be able to ensure that, we'll need to prove that `numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i]`. This is an automatic proof that dafny can do, so we don't need to add any extra proof steps, let's just add an assertion:
```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
```

Finally, we'll add the `s == sum(numbers[0..i])` invariant to the while loop:
```
while (i < |numbers|)
    invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
    invariant s = sum(numbers[0..i])
```

Now, we can use the `sum_prop` lemma to prove that `s == sum(numbers[0..i])`:

```
assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];
```

Now, the proof is complete:

<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[0..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[0..i + 1][..i] == numbers[0..i];
        sum_prop(numbers[0..i + 1]);
        assert sum(numbers[0..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[0..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The program:
function modp_rec(n: int, p: int): int
  requires p > 0
  requires n >= 0
{
    if n == 0 then 1 % p else (modp_rec(n - 1, p) * 2) % p
}
method modp(n: int, p: int) returns (r: int)
{
  // impl-start
  r := 1 % p;
  var i := 0;
  while i < n
  {
    r := (r * 2) % p;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}


LLM: Let's analyze the given program and add the necessary annotations to make it verify:

1. The recursive function `modp_rec(n, p)` calculates (2^n) mod p. It already has two preconditions:
   - `p > 0`: This ensures we're not dividing by zero when using the modulo operation.
   - `n >= 0`: This ensures the recursion will terminate.

   We should add a postcondition to specify what the function returns:
   `ensures 0 <= modp_rec(n, p) < p`

2. The iterative method `modp(n, p)` is meant to calculate the same thing as `modp_rec(n, p)`. We should add preconditions similar to the recursive function, and a postcondition that relates the result to `modp_rec`:

   ```
   requires p > 0
   requires n >= 0
   ensures r == modp_rec(n, p)
   ```

3. For the while loop in `modp`, we need to add invariants:
   - `0 <= i <= n`: This ensures that `i` stays within bounds.
   - `r == modp_rec(i, p)`: This relates the current value of `r` to the recursive function.
   - `0 <= r < p`: This ensures that `r` always remains within the range [0, p-1].

4. We should also add an assertion after the loop to help Dafny verify that the postcondition is met:
   `assert i == n;`

With these annotations, the program should verify. Here's the complete annotated version:

<answer>
function modp_rec(n: int, p: int): int
  requires p > 0
  requires n >= 0
  ensures 0 <= modp_rec(n, p) < p
{
    if n == 0 then 1 % p else (modp_rec(n - 1, p) * 2) % p
}

method modp(n: int, p: int) returns (r: int)
  requires p > 0
  requires n >= 0
  ensures r == modp_rec(n, p)
{
  // impl-start
  r := 1 % p;
  var i := 0;
  while i < n
    invariant 0 <= i <= n
    invariant r == modp_rec(i, p)
    invariant 0 <= r < p
  {
    r := (r * 2) % p;
    i := i + 1;
  }
  assert i == n;
  // impl-end
}
