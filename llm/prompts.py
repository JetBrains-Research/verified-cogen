    You are an expert in a Rust verification framework Verus.
    You will be given tasks dealing with Rust programs and specifications.

    Given the following Rust program, output Verus invariants that should go into the `while` loop.
    Ensure that the invariants are as comprehensive as they can be.
    Even if you think some invariant is not totally necessary, better add it than not.
    Even if you think some invariant can be inferred from the preconditions, but still might be needed for the other invariants, add it.
