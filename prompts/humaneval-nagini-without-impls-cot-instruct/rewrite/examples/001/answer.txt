During the previous steps, we've found that the `sum_loop` function lacks implementation. We've divided its implementation into 3 parts:
1. Initialization of variables of sum `s` and index `i`
```
s = int(0)
i = int(0)
```
2. Going through the cycle and adding elements of list `numbers` to the sum `s`:
```
while (i) < (len(numbers)):
    Invariant(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Invariant(0 <= i and i <= len(numbers))
    Invariant(Forall(int, lambda d_1_p_:
        (Implies(0 <= d_1_p_ and d_1_p_ < len(numbers), Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_) + numbers[d_1_p_]), [[Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1)]])))
    Invariant(s == Sum(numbers, 0, i))
    Assert(Sum(numbers, 0, i + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, i) + numbers[i])
    s = s + (numbers)[i]
    i = i + 1
```
3. Returning variable of sum `s`
```
return s
```

Let's combine them together:
```
def sum_loop(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    Requires(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Result() == Sum(numbers, 0, len(numbers)))
    s = int(0)
    i = int(0)
    while (i) < (len(numbers)):
        Invariant(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
        Invariant(0 <= i and i <= len(numbers))
        Invariant(Forall(int, lambda d_1_p_:
            (Implies(0 <= d_1_p_ and d_1_p_ < len(numbers), Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_) + numbers[d_1_p_]), [[Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1)]])))
        Invariant(s == Sum(numbers, 0, i))
        Assert(Sum(numbers, 0, i + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, i) + numbers[i])
        s = s + (numbers)[i]
        i = i + 1
    return s
```

Other than that, we didn't find any other functions with missed implementations. Therefore, the resulting program is (notice the lack of backticks):
<answer>
from typing import cast, List, Dict, Set, Optional, Union
from nagini_contracts.contracts import *

@Pure
def Sum(a : List[int], s : int, t : int) -> int :
    Requires(Acc(list_pred(a)))
    Requires(((0) <= (s)) and ((s) <= (t)) and ((t) <= (len(a))))

    if s == t:
        return 0
    else:
        return (a)[t - 1] + (Sum(a, s, t - 1))

def sum_loop(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    Requires(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Result() == Sum(numbers, 0, len(numbers)))
    s = int(0)
    i = int(0)
    while (i) < (len(numbers)):
        Invariant(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
        Invariant(0 <= i and i <= len(numbers))
        Invariant(Forall(int, lambda d_1_p_:
            (Implies(0 <= d_1_p_ and d_1_p_ < len(numbers), Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_) + numbers[d_1_p_]), [[Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1)]])))
        Invariant(s == Sum(numbers, 0, i))
        Assert(Sum(numbers, 0, i + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, i) + numbers[i])
        s = s + (numbers)[i]
        i = i + 1
    return s
