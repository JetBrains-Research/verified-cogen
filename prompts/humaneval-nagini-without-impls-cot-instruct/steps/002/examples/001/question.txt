Given the following program, for each function, determine if it has a specification and implementation. Determine functions, that can be used in specifications. Determine also functions, that need to provide implementation with invariants.
```
from typing import cast, List, Dict, Set, Optional, Union
from nagini_contracts.contracts import *

@Pure
def Sum(a : List[int], s : int, t : int) -> int :
    Requires(Acc(list_pred(a)))
    Requires(((0) <= (s)) and ((s) <= (t)) and ((t) <= (len(a))))

    if s == t:
        return 0
    else:
        return (a)[t - 1] + (Sum(a, s, t - 1))

def sum_loop(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    Requires(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Result() == Sum(numbers, 0, len(numbers)))
