The verifier timed out during the verification.
This usually means that the provided invariants were too broad or were difficult to check.
You should modify implementations, invariants or asserts, if necessary.
You should not modify any helper functions (annotated with @Pure), remember they are here to help you with verification.
Could you please try to improve the invariants and try again?
