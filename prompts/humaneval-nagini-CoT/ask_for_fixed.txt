The following errors occurred during verification:
{error}

Please fix the error by adding, removing or modifying the invariants and return the fixed program.
Don't add any additional text comments, your response must contain only program with invariants.
Do not provide ANY explanations. Don't include markdown backticks. Respond only in Python code, nothing else.

Pay attention to important details of Nagini syntax:
1. You should use only single inequalities of type `a <= b` or equalities `a == b`
2. Use `Acc(list_pred(x))` invariants for variables of type List[] (for example, if x is of type List[int], add `Acc(list_pred(x))` invariants to all cycles in the scope of variable x)
3. Try to reuse the invariants, encountered as preconditions and postconditions, if these invariants hold during cycle execution
4. Don't use any built-in functions
5. Put invariants into beginning of each cycle
