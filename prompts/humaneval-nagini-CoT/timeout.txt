The verifier timed out during the verification.
This usually means that the provided invariants were too broad or were difficult to check.
Most probably you will need to add some invariants, that can help with verification of the current invariants or postconditions, or
delete unnecessary invariants.
Could you please try to improve the invariants and try again?
