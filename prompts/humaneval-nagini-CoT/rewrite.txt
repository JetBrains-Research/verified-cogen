Request:
    Rewrite the following Python program, adding correct Nagini invariants into `while` loops.
    Do not change the code, only add the invariants.
    Ensure that the invariants are as comprehensive as they can be.
    Even if you think some invariant is not totally necessary, better add it than not.
    Don't add any additional text comments, your response must contain only program with invariants.
    Provide JSON with described steps and Python code. Python code should not contain any explanations. Your response should contain only JSON.
    Remember: strings in JSON format cannot contain any new lines.

    Pay attention to important details of Nagini syntax:
    1. You should use only single inequalities of type `a <= b` or equalities `a == b`
    2. Use `Acc(list_pred(x))` invariants for variables of type List[] (for example, if x is of type List[int], add `Acc(list_pred(x))` invariants to all cycles in the scope of variable x)
    3. Try to reuse the invariants, encountered as preconditions and postconditions, if these invariants hold during cycle execution
    4. Don't use any built-in functions
    5. Put invariants into begginning of each cycle

    The program:
    ```
        from typing import cast, List, Dict, Set, Optional, Union
        from nagini_contracts.contracts import *

        @Pure
        def getVal(mx: Optional[int]) -> int:
            Requires(mx is not None)
            return mx

        def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
            Requires(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
            Ensures(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
            Ensures(Acc(list_pred(Result())))
            Ensures(len(Result()) == len(numbers))
            Ensures(Forall(range(len(numbers)), lambda i: numbers[i] <= Result()[i]))
            Ensures(Forall(range(len(numbers) - 1), lambda i: Result()[i] <= Result()[i + 1]))

            running_max = None # type: Optional[int]
            result = [] # type: List[int]

            i = 0
            while i < len(numbers):
                n = numbers[i]
                if running_max is None or running_max < n:
                    running_max = n

                result.append(running_max)
                i += 1

            return result
