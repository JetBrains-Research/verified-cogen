During the previous steps, we've found that the `sum_loop` function has a loop that goes over the elements of the array `numbers` and adds them to the `s` variable, which is equal to the `Sum(numbers, 0, i)` for all `i`, such that `0 <= i and i <= len(numbers)`. Also we need list access to numbers. This means that during the execution of the loop the following invariant holds:
1. `Acc(list_pred(numbers))`
2. `0 <= i and i <= len(numbers)`
3. `s == Sum(numbers, 0, i)`

The third invariant might be a bit difficult to prove, as it adds the last element of the array to the sum, while, as I've said before, the `Sum` function is defined as `Sum(a, 0, i + 1) == Sum(a, 0, i) + a[i]`. However, as we've seen, it's possible to use additional invariants and assertions to prove this invariants holds.
Let's work out how to use it. One of the ways to prove it is to add the following invariants and assertions:
```
Invariant(Forall(int, lambda d_1_p_:
    (Implies(0 <= d_1_p_ and d_1_p_ < len(numbers), Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_) + numbers[d_1_p_]), [[Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1)]])))
Assert(Sum(numbers, 0, i + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, i) + numbers[i])
```

In conclusion, we can say that two invariants hold and the third one could be proved using additional invariants and assertions.
