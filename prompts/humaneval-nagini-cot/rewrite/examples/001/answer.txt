During the previous steps, we've found that the `sum_loop` function has a loop that goes over the elements of the array `numbers` and adds them to the `s` variable, which is equal to the `Sum(numbers, 0, i)` for all `i`, such that `0 <= i and i <= len(numbers)`. Also we need list access to numbers. This means that during the execution of the loop the following invariant holds:
1. `Acc(list_pred(numbers))`
2. `0 <= i and i <= len(numbers)`
3. `s == Sum(numbers, 0, i)`

Let's put them in:
```
from typing import cast, List, Dict, Set, Optional, Union
from nagini_contracts.contracts import *

@Pure
def Sum(a : List[int], s : int, t : int) -> int :
    Requires(Acc(list_pred(a)))
    Requires(((0) <= (s)) and ((s) <= (t)) and ((t) <= (len(a))))

    if s == t:
        return 0
    else:
        return (a)[t - 1] + (Sum(a, s, t - 1))

def sum_loop(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    Requires(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Result() == Sum(numbers, 0, len(numbers)))
    s = int(0)
    i = int(0)
    while (i) < (len(numbers)):
        s = s + (numbers)[i]
        i = i + 1
    return s
```

We've also worked out how to prove the third invariant. For that we need to prove to the verifier that `Sum(numbers, 0, i + 1)== Sum(numbers, 0, i) + numbers[i]`. For that we need to add the following invariants and asserts:
```
Invariant(Forall(int, lambda d_1_p_:
    (Implies(0 <= d_1_p_ and d_1_p_ < len(numbers), Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_) + numbers[d_1_p_]), [[Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1)]])))
Assert(Sum(numbers, 0, i + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, i) + numbers[i])
```
Let's add these lines to the code:
```
from typing import cast, List, Dict, Set, Optional, Union
from nagini_contracts.contracts import *

@Pure
def Sum(a : List[int], s : int, t : int) -> int :
    Requires(Acc(list_pred(a)))
    Requires(((0) <= (s)) and ((s) <= (t)) and ((t) <= (len(a))))

    if s == t:
        return 0
    else:
        return (a)[t - 1] + (Sum(a, s, t - 1))

def sum_loop(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    Requires(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Result() == Sum(numbers, 0, len(numbers)))
    s = int(0)
    i = int(0)
    while (i) < (len(numbers)):
        Invariant(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
        Invariant(0 <= i and i <= len(numbers))
        Invariant(Forall(int, lambda d_1_p_:
            (Implies(0 <= d_1_p_ and d_1_p_ < len(numbers), Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_) + numbers[d_1_p_]), [[Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1)]])))
        Invariant(s == Sum(numbers, 0, i))
        Assert(Sum(numbers, 0, i + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, i) + numbers[i])
        s = s + (numbers)[i]
        i = i + 1
    return s
```

Other than that, we didn't find any other invariants or patterns that hold during the execution of the program. Therefore, the resulting program is (notice the lack of backticks):
<answer>
from typing import cast, List, Dict, Set, Optional, Union
from nagini_contracts.contracts import *

@Pure
def Sum(a : List[int], s : int, t : int) -> int :
    Requires(Acc(list_pred(a)))
    Requires(((0) <= (s)) and ((s) <= (t)) and ((t) <= (len(a))))

    if s == t:
        return 0
    else:
        return (a)[t - 1] + (Sum(a, s, t - 1))

def sum_loop(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    Requires(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
    Ensures(Result() == Sum(numbers, 0, len(numbers)))
    s = int(0)
    i = int(0)
    while (i) < (len(numbers)):
        Invariant(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
        Invariant(0 <= i and i <= len(numbers))
        Invariant(Forall(int, lambda d_1_p_:
            (Implies(0 <= d_1_p_ and d_1_p_ < len(numbers), Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_) + numbers[d_1_p_]), [[Sum(numbers, 0, d_1_p_ + 1)]])))
        Invariant(s == Sum(numbers, 0, i))
        Assert(Sum(numbers, 0, i + 1) == Sum(numbers, 0, i) + numbers[i])
        s = s + (numbers)[i]
        i = i + 1
    return s
