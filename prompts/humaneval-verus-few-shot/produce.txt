Given the following verus program, output invariants and assertions which are required to prove the program correct.
Ensure that the invariants are as comprehensive as they can be.
Even if you think some invariant is not totally necessary, better add it than not.
Don't add any additional text comments, your response must contain only program with invariants.
Do not provide ANY explanations. Don't include markdown backticks. Respond only in Python code, nothing else.

The program:
{program}
