Given the following Python program, output Nagini invariants that should go into the `while` loop.
Ensure that the invariants are as comprehensive as they can be.
Even if you think some invariant is not totally necessary, better add it than not.
Don't add any additional text comments, your response must contain only program with invariants.
Do not provide ANY explanations. Don't include markdown backticks. Respond only in Python code, nothing else.

Pay attention to important details of Nagini syntax:
1. You should use only single inequalities of type `a <= b` or equalities `a == b`
2. Use `Acc(list_pred(x))` invariants for variables of type List[] (for example, if x is of type List[int], add `Acc(list_pred(x))` invariants to all cycles in the scope of variable x)
3. Try to reuse the invariants, encountered as preconditions and postconditions, if these invariants hold during cycle execution
4. Don't use any built-in functions

Here are some examples of verified Python cycles with Nagini invariants:
```
    while i < len(numbers):
        Invariant(Acc(list_pred(numbers)))
        Invariant(Acc(list_pred(result)))
        Invariant(0 <= i and i <= len(numbers))
        Invariant(len(result) == i)
        Invariant(Forall(range(i), lambda i1: numbers[i1] <= result[i1]))
        Invariant(Old(running_max) is None or ((Old(running_max) is not None) and (getVal(Old(running_max)) <= getVal(running_max))))
        Invariant(Implies(len(result) > 0, running_max is not None))
        Invariant(Implies(len(result) > 0, result[-1] == getVal(running_max)))
        Invariant(Forall(range(i - 1), lambda i1: result[i1] <= result[i1 + 1]))

        n = numbers[i]
        if running_max is None or running_max < n:
            running_max = n

        result.append(running_max)
        i += 1
```

```
    while (d_0_i_) < (len((a))):
        Invariant(Acc(list_pred(c)))
        Invariant(Acc(list_pred(a)))
        Invariant(len(c) == len(a) + 1)
        Invariant(((0) <= (d_0_i_)) and ((d_0_i_) <= (len((a)))))
        Invariant(Forall(int, lambda d_1_ii_:
            Implies(((0) <= (d_1_ii_)) and ((d_1_ii_) < (d_0_i_)), ((c)[d_1_ii_]) == ((a)[d_1_ii_]))))
        (c)[(d_0_i_)] = (a)[d_0_i_]
        d_0_i_ = (d_0_i_) + (1)
```

The program:
