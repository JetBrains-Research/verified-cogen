Given the following Python program, output Nagini invariants that should go into the `while` loop.
Ensure that the invariants are as comprehensive as they can be.
Even if you think some invariant is not totally necessary, better add it than not.
Don't add any additional text comments, your response must contain only program with invariants.
The program:
{program}
