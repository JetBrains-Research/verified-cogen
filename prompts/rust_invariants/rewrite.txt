Rewrite the following Rust program, adding correct Verus invariants into `while` loops.
Do not change the code, only add the invariants.
Ensure that the invariants are as comprehensive as they can be.
Even if you think some invariant is not totally necessary, better add it than not.
The program:
{program}
