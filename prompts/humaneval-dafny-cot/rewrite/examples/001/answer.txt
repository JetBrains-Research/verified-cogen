During the previous steps, we've found that the `sum_loop` function has a loop that goes over the elements of the array `numbers` and adds them to the `s` variable, which is equal to the `sum(numbers[..i])` for all `i`, such that `0 <= i <= |numbers|`. This means that during the execution of the loop the following invariant holds:
1. `0 <= i <= |numbers|`
2. `s == sum(numbers[..i])`

Let's put them in:
```dafny
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

We've also worked out how to prove the second invariant. For that we need to prove to the verifier that `sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i]) + numbers[i]`. For that we need to use the `sum_prop` function, as follows:
```dafny
assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]; // assert that taking a slice of a slice is the same as taking a slice of the original array
sum_prop(numbers[..i + 1]); // use a lemma to prove the invariant
assert sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i];
```
Let's add these lines to the code:
```dafny
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]; // assert that taking a slice of a slice is the same as taking a slice of the original array
        sum_prop(numbers[..i + 1]); // use a lemma to prove the invariant
        assert sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

Other than that, we didn't find any other invariants or patterns that hold during the execution of the program. Therefore, the resulting program is (notice the lack of backticks):
<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]; // assert that taking a slice of a slice is the same as taking a slice of the original array
        sum_prop(numbers[..i + 1]); // use a lemma to prove the invariant
        assert sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
