Given the following Python program, output Nagini invariants that should go into the `while` loop.
Ensure that the invariants are as comprehensive as they can be.

Don't add any additional text comments, your response must contain only program with invariants.
Do not provide ANY explanations. Don't include markdown backticks. Respond only in Python code, nothing else.
The program:
