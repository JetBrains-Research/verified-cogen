Rewrite the following Python program, adding correct Nagini invariants into `while` loops.
Do not change the code, only add the invariants.
Ensure that the invariants are as comprehensive as they can be.
Even if you think some invariant is not totally necessary, better add it than not.
Don't add any additional text comments, your response must contain only program with invariants.
Do not provide ANY explanations. Don't include markdown backticks. Respond only in Python code, nothing else.
Also add assertions in necessary places.
Do not change the code, only add invariants and assertions. Don't remove any helper functions, they are there to help you.

The program:
{program}
