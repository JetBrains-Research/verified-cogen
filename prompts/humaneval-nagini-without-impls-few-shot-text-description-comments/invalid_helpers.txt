We detected an improper usage of helper functions. Here is the list of helper functions used in a wrong way:
{invalid_helpers}
You should use helper functions only in invariants, asserts and conditions (in `if` or `while` conditions), not in the plain code.
The following helper functions you can use anywhere: {helpers}.
We replaced all improper usages with `invalid_call()` and got the following program:
{program}
You should rewrite this program without changing pre/postconditions and helper functions (denoted with @Pure).
After rewriting your code should verify.
Your code should not contain any `invalid_call()` invocations.
