LLM: Let's go function by function. The first function, `sum` does not have a specification, as can be seen by the absence of either a `requires` or `ensures` clause. This means that this function is probably a specification itself. Let's consider, what it can be step by step. We can see that the aruguments to this function are a sequence of integers. We can see that the function returns an integer. We can conclude that the function does some accumulation of integers from the sequence. Looking at the body, we can see that the function takes the first element of the sequence and adds it to the accumulated result of evaluating the `sum` function on the rest of the sequence. This means the function is a specification for the sum of the elements of the sequence.

Next, we have the `sum_prop` lemma. Considering it's specification, we can see that it requires a non-empty sequence of integers, as seen by the `requires |s| > 0` clause. Looking at the ensures clause, we can see that the lemma ensures that the sum of the sequence (as computed by the `sum` function) is equal to the sum of the elements of the sequence without the last element, plus that last element. This is important to prove, because the sum function drops the first element and thus it is not obvious for the prover that the last element can be dropped in the same way.

Finally, we have the `sum_loop` method. This method has a specification, as indicated by the `ensures` clause. The specification states that the returned value `s` should be equal to the sum of the input sequence `numbers`, as computed by the `sum` function, as seen by the `ensures s == sum(numbers)` clause.

In summary:
1. The `sum` function is itself a specification for computing the sum of a sequence of integers.
2. The `sum_prop` lemma has a specification that proves a property about the `sum` function.
3. The `sum_loop` method has a specification that ensures it correctly computes the sum of a sequence of integers, matching the result of the `sum` function.

User: Now we are finished with the specifications. Let's move onto the loops.
Given the following program, for each function, determine if it has loops. If it does, try to determine what the loop does in detail. Go through all your thinking and reasoning process step by step.
```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

LLM: Looking at the functions, we can see that the 'sum' function uses recursion and thus contains no loops. The 'sum_prop' lemma, in the same way, does not contain any loops, as evidenced by the absence of 'while' and 'for' keywords.
Now, let's examine the 'sum_loop' method. This method contains a while loop that iterates through the elements of the 'numbers' sequence. The loop starts with 's' and 'i' initialized to 0, and continues as long as 'i' is less than the length of 'numbers'. Let's try to understand what 's' and 'i' represent in this context.

Looking at the body of the loop, we can see that it adds the current element of 'numbers' to 's'. This means that 's' is the running sum of the elements in 'numbers', namely 's = sum(numbers[..i])'. 'i' is easier to analyze. It is the index of the current element being processed. In each iteration of the loop, 'i' is incremented by 1, so 'i' represents the index of the next element to be processed.

Each iteration of the loop adds the current element to 's', and then increments 'i' to move to the next element. This process continues until 'i' reaches the length of 'numbers', at which point the loop terminates and 's' holds the final sum of the elements in 'numbers'.

User: As we've already analyzed the specifications and the loops, it's time to try to analyze what invariants and patterns hold during the execution of the program. Go over the found loops in the following program in the code and try to find out what invariants and patterns they hold. Go through all your thinking and reasoning process step by step.
```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

LLM: As we've seen, the loop in the `sum_loop` function goes over the elements of the array `numbers` and adds them to the `s` variable, which is equal to the `sum(numbers[..i])` for all `i`, such that `0 <= i <= |numbers|`. This means that during the execution of the loop the following invariant holds:
1. `0 <= i <= |numbers|`
2. `s == sum(numbers[..i])`

The second invariant might be a bit difficult to prove, as it adds the last element of the array to the sum, while, as I've said before, the `sum` function is defined as `sum(a) == a[0] + sum(a[1..])`. However, as we've seen, it's possible to use the `sum_prop` function to prove that this invariant holds.
Let's work out how to use it. If applied to the `numbers[..i + 1]`, we get:
`sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i]`. It might be difficult for dafny to prove that `sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) == sum(numbers[..i])`, so I'd suggest adding an assertion before calling `sum_prop` to make sure that this is the case, namely `assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]`.
So, to use the `sum_prop`, I'd suggest the following code:
```
assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]; // assert that taking a slice of a slice is the same as taking a slice of the original array
sum_prop(numbers[..i + 1]); // use a lemma to prove the invariant
assert sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i];
```

In conclusion, we can say that two invariants hold and the second one could be proved using the `sum_prop` function.

User: Given the following program, for each function, determine if it has a specification. If it does not, is it itself a specification? If it is a specification, what does it specify?

        var distance: int := abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]);
        if (distance < threshold)
        {
          flag := true;
        }
      }
      j := j + 1;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}
```

LLM: Let's analyze each function in the given program:

1. `abs` method:
   This method has a specification. It is defined by two `ensures` clauses:
   - `ensures val < 0 ==> res == -val`
   - `ensures val >= 0 ==> res == val`
   These specify that the method returns the absolute value of the input.

2. `abs1` function:
   This function does not have an explicit specification (no `requires` or `ensures` clauses). However, it is itself a specification. It specifies a boolean function that returns true if the absolute value of `x` is greater than or equal to `threshold`.

3. `has_close_elements` method:
   This method has both pre-conditions and post-conditions, forming its specification:
   
   Pre-condition:
   - `requires threshold > 0`
   
   Post-condition:
   - `ensures flag == (exists i: int, j: int :: i >= 0 && j >= 0 && i < |numbers| && j < |numbers| && i != j && !abs1(numbers[i] - numbers[j], threshold))`

   The post-condition specifies that the returned `flag` is true if and only if there exist two distinct elements in the `numbers` sequence whose difference has an absolute value less than the `threshold`.

In summary:
1. `abs` has a specification.
2. `abs1` is itself a specification.
3. `has_close_elements` has a specification.

LLM: Let's analyze each function in the program for loops:

1. `abs` method:
   This method does not contain any loops. It uses a simple if-else statement to determine the absolute value.

2. `abs1` function:
   This function does not contain any loops. It's a single-line boolean expression.

3. `has_close_elements` method:
   This method contains two nested loops. Let's analyze them in detail:

   Outer loop:
   ```dafny
   while (i < |numbers|)
   ```
   - This loop iterates through all elements of the `numbers` sequence.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - It continues until `i` reaches the length of the `numbers` sequence.

   Inner loop:
   ```dafny
   while (j < |numbers|)
   ```
   - This loop also iterates through all elements of the `numbers` sequence.
   - The loop variable `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - It continues until `j` reaches the length of the `numbers` sequence.

   The purpose of these nested loops is to compare each element of the sequence with every other element. Here's what happens in each iteration:

   1. If `i` and `j` are not equal (to avoid comparing an element with itself):
      - It calculates the absolute difference between `numbers[i]` and `numbers[j]` using the `abs` method.
      - If this difference is less than the given `threshold`:
        - It sets `flag` to true, indicating that close elements have been found.

   2. The inner loop increments `j`.
   3. When the inner loop completes, the outer loop increments `i`.

   The loops continue until all pairs of elements have been compared. If any pair of elements is found to have a difference less than the threshold, the `flag` will be set to true and remain true until the end of the method.

In summary, only the `has_close_elements` method contains loops. These nested loops are used to compare all pairs of elements in the input sequence to determine if any pair has a difference less than the given threshold.

In each iteration of the loop, 'i' is incremented by 1, so 'i' represents the index of the next element to be processed.

Each iteration of the loop adds the current element to 's', and then increments 'i' to move to the next element. This process continues until 'i' reaches the length of 'numbers', at which point the loop terminates and 's' holds the final sum of the elements in 'numbers'.

User: As we've already analyzed the specifications and the loops, it's time to try to analyze what invariants and patterns hold during the execution of the program. Go over the found loops in the following program in the code and try to find out what invariants and patterns they hold. Go through all your thinking and reasoning process step by step.
```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

LLM: As we've seen, the loop in the `sum_loop` function goes over the elements of the array `numbers` and adds them to the `s` variable, which is equal to the `sum(numbers[..i])` for all `i`, such that `0 <= i <= |numbers|`. This means that during the execution of the loop the following invariant holds:
1. `0 <= i <= |numbers|`
2. `s == sum(numbers[..i])`

The second invariant might be a bit difficult to prove, as it adds the last element of the array to the sum, while, as I've said before, the `sum` function is defined as `sum(a) == a[0] + sum(a[1..])`. However, as we've seen, it's possible to use the `sum_prop` function to prove that this invariant holds.
Let's work out how to use it. If applied to the `numbers[..i + 1]`, we get:
`sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i]`. It might be difficult for dafny to prove that `sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) == sum(numbers[..i])`, so I'd suggest adding an assertion before calling `sum_prop` to make sure that this is the case, namely `assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]`.
So, to use the `sum_prop`, I'd suggest the following code:
```
assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]; // assert that taking a slice of a slice is the same as taking a slice of the original array
sum_prop(numbers[..i + 1]); // use a lemma to prove the invariant
assert sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i];
```

In conclusion, we can say that two invariants hold and the second one could be proved using the `sum_prop` function.

User: As we've already analyzed the specifications and the loops, it's time to try to analyze what invariants and patterns hold during the execution of the program. Go over the found loops in the following program in the code and try to find out what invariants and patterns they hold. Go through all your thinking and reasoning process step by step.
```dafny
method abs(val : int) returns (res : int)
    ensures val < 0 ==> res == -val
    ensures val >= 0 ==> res == val
{
    if (val < 0) {
        res := -val;
    } else {
        res := val;
    }
}
function abs1(x : int, threshold : int): bool
{
    x >= threshold || x <= -threshold
}
method has_close_elements(numbers: seq<int>, threshold: int) returns (flag : bool)
  // pre-conditions-start
  requires threshold > 0
  // pre-conditions-end
  // post-conditions-start
  ensures flag == (exists i: int, j: int :: i >= 0 && j >= 0 && i < |numbers| && j < |numbers| && i != j && !abs1(numbers[i] - numbers[j], threshold))
  // post-conditions-end
{
  // impl-start
  flag := false;
  var i: int := 0;
  while (i < |numbers|)
  {
    var j: int := 0;
    while (j < |numbers|)
    {
      if (i != j)
      {
        var distance: int := abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]);
        if (distance < threshold)
        {
          flag := true;
        }
      }
      j := j + 1;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  // impl-end
}
```

LLM: Let's analyze the loops in the `has_close_elements` method and identify the invariants and patterns:

1. Outer loop:
   ```dafny
   while (i < |numbers|)
   ```
   Invariants:
   a. 0 <= i <= |numbers|
   b. flag == (exists k, l :: 0 <= k < i && 0 <= l < |numbers| && k != l && !abs1(numbers[k] - numbers[l], threshold))

   The first invariant (a) is straightforward. The second invariant (b) states that the flag is true if and only if there exist two elements (up to the current i) that are closer than the threshold.

2. Inner loop:
   ```dafny
   while (j < |numbers|)
   ```
   Invariants:
   a. 0 <= j <= |numbers|
   b. flag == (exists k, l :: (0 <= k < i && 0 <= l < |numbers| && k != l && !abs1(numbers[k] - numbers[l], threshold)) || 
                              (k == i && 0 <= l < j && !abs1(numbers[k] - numbers[l], threshold)))

   The first invariant (a) is straightforward. The second invariant (b) extends the outer loop invariant by including comparisons of the current i with all j values up to the current j.

Patterns:
1. The nested loop structure allows comparison of each element with every other element in the sequence.
2. The `flag` variable acts as a short-circuit: once it becomes true, it remains true for the rest of the execution.
3. The `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between two elements, ensuring that the order of subtraction doesn't matter.
4. The condition `i != j` prevents comparing an element with itself.

Reasoning process:
1. We start by considering what properties should hold at the beginning and end of each loop iteration.
2. For the outer loop, we realize that `i` represents how many elements we've fully processed (compared with all other elements).
3. For the inner loop, `j` represents the current element being compared with the i-th element.
4. The `flag` variable accumulates the result of all comparisons made so far.
5. We need to ensure that our invariants capture the state of `flag` accurately at each point in the execution.
6. The use of existential quantifiers in the invariants allows us to express the idea of "finding at least one pair" of close elements.
7. We need to be careful about the ranges of the quantified variables in our invariants to accurately represent the progress of the loops.

These invariants and patterns help ensure that the method correctly implements its specification, checking all pairs of elements and setting the flag appropriately.
User: Given the following program, for each function, determine if it has a specification. If it does not, is it itself a specification? If it is a specification, what does it specify?
```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

LLM: Let's go function by function. The first function, `sum` does not have a specification, as can be seen by the absence of either a `requires` or `ensures` clause. This means that this function is probably a specification itself. Let's consider, what it can be step by step. We can see that the aruguments to this function are a sequence of integers. We can see that the function returns an integer. We can conclude that the function does some accumulation of integers from the sequence. Looking at the body, we can see that the function takes the first element of the sequence and adds it to the accumulated result of evaluating the `sum` function on the rest of the sequence. This means the function is a specification for the sum of the elements of the sequence.

Next, we have the `sum_prop` lemma. Considering it's specification, we can see that it requires a non-empty sequence of integers, as seen by the `requires |s| > 0` clause. Looking at the ensures clause, we can see that the lemma ensures that the sum of the sequence (as computed by the `sum` function) is equal to the sum of the elements of the sequence without the last element, plus that last element. This is important to prove, because the sum function drops the first element and thus it is not obvious for the prover that the last element can be dropped in the same way.

Finally, we have the `sum_loop` method. This method has a specification, as indicated by the `ensures` clause. The specification states that the returned value `s` should be equal to the sum of the input sequence `numbers`, as computed by the `sum` function, as seen by the `ensures s == sum(numbers)` clause.

In summary:
1. The `sum` function is itself a specification for computing the sum of a sequence of integers.
2. The `sum_prop` lemma has a specification that proves a property about the `sum` function.
3. The `sum_loop` method has a specification that ensures it correctly computes the sum of a sequence of integers, matching the result of the `sum` function.

User: Now we are finished with the specifications. Let's move onto the loops.
Given the following program, for each function, determine if it has loops. If it does, try to determine what the loop does in detail. Go through all your thinking and reasoning process step by step.
```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

LLM: Looking at the functions, we can see that the 'sum' function uses recursion and thus contains no loops. The 'sum_prop' lemma, in the same way, does not contain any loops, as evidenced by the absence of 'while' and 'for' keywords.
Now, let's examine the 'sum_loop' method. This method contains a while loop that iterates through the elements of the 'numbers' sequence. The loop starts with 's' and 'i' initialized to 0, and continues as long as 'i' is less than the length of 'numbers'. Let's try to understand what 's' and 'i' represent in this context.

Looking at the body of the loop, we can see that it adds the current element of 'numbers' to 's'. This means that 's' is the running sum of the elements in 'numbers', namely 's = sum(numbers[..i])'. 'i' is easier to analyze. It is the index of the current element being processed. In each iteration of the loop, 'i' is incremented by 1, so 'i' represents the index of the next element to be processed.

Each iteration of the loop adds the current element to 's', and then increments 'i' to move to the next element. This process continues until 'i' reaches the length of 'numbers', at which point the loop terminates and 's' holds the final sum of the elements in 'numbers'.

User: As we've already analyzed the specifications and the loops, it's time to try to analyze what invariants and patterns hold during the execution of the program. Go over the found loops in the following program in the code and try to find out what invariants and patterns they hold. Go through all your thinking and reasoning process step by step.

    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

LLM: As we've seen, the loop in the `sum_loop` function goes over the elements of the array `numbers` and adds them to the `s` variable, which is equal to the `sum(numbers[..i])` for all `i`, such that `0 <= i <= |numbers|`. This means that during the execution of the loop the following invariant holds:
1. `0 <= i <= |numbers|`
2. `s == sum(numbers[..i])`

The second invariant might be a bit difficult to prove, as it adds the last element of the array to the sum, while, as I've said before, the `sum` function is defined as `sum(a) == a[0] + sum(a[1..])`. However, as we've seen, it's possible to use the `sum_prop` function to prove that this invariant holds.
Let's work out how to use it. If applied to the `numbers[..i + 1]`, we get:
`sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i]`. It might be difficult for dafny to prove that `sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) == sum(numbers[..i])`, so I'd suggest adding an assertion before calling `sum_prop` to make sure that this is the case, namely `assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]`.
So, to use the `sum_prop`, I'd suggest the following code:
```
assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]; // assert that taking a slice of a slice is the same as taking a slice of the original array
sum_prop(numbers[..i + 1]); // use a lemma to prove the invariant
assert sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i];
```

In conclusion, we can say that two invariants hold and the second one could be proved using the `sum_prop` function.

User: It's time to rewrite the program to contain the invariants and assertions that we've found. Work on the following program and go step by step through the reasoning process. After that, output the rewritten program in the `<answer>` tag without backticks.

```dafny
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

LLM: During the previous steps, we've found that the `sum_loop` function has a loop that goes over the elements of the array `numbers` and adds them to the `s` variable, which is equal to the `sum(numbers[..i])` for all `i`, such that `0 <= i <= |numbers|`. This means that during the execution of the loop the following invariant holds:
1. `0 <= i <= |numbers|`
2. `s == sum(numbers[..i])`

Let's put them in:
```dafny
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

We've also worked out how to prove the second invariant. For that we need to prove to the verifier that `sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i]) + numbers[i]`. For that we need to use the `sum_prop` function, as follows:
```dafny
assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]; // assert that taking a slice of a slice is the same as taking a slice of the original array
sum_prop(numbers[..i + 1]); // use a lemma to prove the invariant
assert sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i];
```
Let's add these lines to the code:
```dafny
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]; // assert that taking a slice of a slice is the same as taking a slice of the original array
        sum_prop(numbers[..i + 1]); // use a lemma to prove the invariant
        assert sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```

Other than that, we didn't find any other invariants or patterns that hold during the execution of the program. Therefore, the resulting program is (notice the lack of backticks):
<answer>
function sum(s: seq<int>) : int {
    if |s| == 0 then 0 else s[0] + sum(s[1..])
}

lemma sum_prop(s: seq<int>)
    requires |s| > 0
    ensures sum(s) == sum(s[..|s| - 1]) + s[ |s| - 1 ]
{
    if (|s| > 1) {
        assert (s[1..][..|s[1..]| - 1]) == s[1..|s| - 1];
    }
}
method sum_loop(numbers: seq<int>) returns (s: int)
    ensures s == sum(numbers)
{
    s := 0;
    var i := 0;
    while (i < |numbers|)
        invariant 0 <= i <= |numbers|
        invariant s == sum(numbers[..i])
    {
        s := s + numbers[i];

        assert numbers[..i + 1][..i] == numbers[..i]; // assert that taking a slice of a slice is the same as taking a slice of the original array
        sum_prop(numbers[..i + 1]); // use a lemma to prove the invariant
        assert sum(numbers[..i + 1]) == sum(numbers[..i + 1][..i]) + numbers[i];

        i := i + 1;
    }
}
